{"text": "The report for 2015 is due out in the next few weeks, so the most recent report we have is the 2014 one. In the year covered by that report, 1,013 tests were conducted for IPC sports (which include athletics, swimming, powerlifting and skiing) in which prohibited substances were found nine times. During the year, sanctions were taken against 11 athletes. If you break that down into the sports involved it is clear that most of the IPC's anti-doping problems come from the sport of powerlifting, which was the source of seven of the positive tests and eight of the sanctions. The IPC announced in 2014 that it had suspended 13 powerlifters in the previous 14 months. The sport has been targeted with a \"Raise the Bar - Say No! to Doping\" campaign. Since then, the IPC has also adopted a new anti-doping code, which came into effect on 1 January 2015. Paralympic athletes have the same list of banned substances as Olympic athletes and, like them, anyone who requires additional medication for pain or treatment must apply for an exemption. \"It's a common misconception that a lot of Paralympians will be on prescription drugs. That's not the case at all,\" Nicole Sapstead, UK Anti-Doping chief executive, told the BBC ahead of London 2012. \"Obviously there are athletes with spinal injuries and they need pain relief. But mostly it is the same as the Olympics - things like asthma and diabetes.\" Only one athlete was given a doping sanction at the Sochi Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, but since then the McLaren Report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia's sports ministry manipulated urine samples provided by its athletes between 2011 and 2015. The report identified 27 samples relating to eight Para-sports, five of which are summer sports, including some governed by the IPC. The IPC also found evidence that samples were swapped during the Sochi Winter Paralympics, adding that it planned to reanalyse every Russian sample given at the event. So now the Russian team has been banned from this year's Paralympic Games in Rio, and the IPC is wondering if it has more of a doping problem than it previously thought.", "summary": "Every four years the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) releases its annual anti-doping report.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary makes up the full name of the IPC", "The summary makes up that there's 4 years between reports", "The summary states that the IPC releases an annual anti-doping report, but the text does not explicitly state that the report is specifically an \"anti-doping\" report.

{"text": "The review panel says WHO was too slow to act to get on top of the deadly virus which has now killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa. And it calls for an urgent overhaul of the organisation. WHO says it has plans for reform. It has already admitted that it waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern. WHO Director General, Margaret Chan, admitted in May it had been \"overwhelmed\" by the Ebola outbreak, saying it \"shook this organization to its core\". The disease began spreading in December 2013, but it took until August 2014 for WHO to sound the alarm. By that point, more than 1,000 people had died of the virus. The death toll now stands at more than 11,000. According to the report, WHO lacked a culture of rapid decision-making. In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent about the seriousness of the situation but these \"either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance\". \"There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action,\" the report says. WHO was also criticised for failing to keep governments and the public up to speed about the extent and severity of the outbreak. But the review praised WHO for playing a critical role in pushing forward work to find new treatments and cures for Ebola. And it said WHO should be given the job of leading future health emergency responses - be that for Ebola or an outbreak of pandemic flu, for example. The report suggests an immediate contribution from all member countries towards a $100 million special outbreak response fund, and says WHO should establish a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The panel's head, Dame Barbara Stocking, former chief executive of the charity Oxfam, said the WHO must now be made fit for the task. \"To me, coming from somewhere like Oxfam which is an emergency culture, you are very much, if you like, on the front foot. You are always trying to prevent a situation coming through or grab it when it starts and really get it under control very fast and those are some of the internal changes that have to be made at WHO.\" The WHO said it was \"already moving forward\" on some of the panel's recommendations including the development of the global health emergency workforce and the contingency fund. It will be up to member states to make these voluntary financial contributions. Dr Joanne Liu, President of MSF International, questioned how the recommendations would translate to real action on the ground. \"We have seen so many reports calling for change, with everyone focused on how to improve future response and meanwhile, with 20-25 new Ebola cases per week in the region, we still don`t have the current epidemic under control. On Ebola, we went from global indifference, to global fear, to global response and now to global fatigue. We must finish the job,\" she said. Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said the support of the global community was crucial if we are to avert another catastrophe on the scale of Ebola.\"", "summary": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has been criticised in a report for its handling of the Ebola outbreak.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "dev", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1537}

{"text": "The former Manchester United striker, best known for his winning goal against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final, arrived with great fanfare in January 2014. He presented a different vision for Cardiff compared with the defensive approach of his predecessor Malky Mackay, renowned for an unspectacular, yet effective style that gained the club promotion to the Premier League in 2013. Mackay's success meant popularity with fans and that probably didn't help Solskjaer's cause. The Scot's bitter falling-out with the club's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan had disillusioned many supporters who saw Mackay's sacking as a regression for a club who had fought so hard for a top-flight return after half a century away. He may have promised a more exciting style, but under Solskjaer the Bluebirds slipped into the Premier League's bottom three for the first time and never recovered, finishing bottom. The results were shocking - 3-0 at Swansea, 6-3 against Liverpool, 3-0 defeats against Crystal Palace and Newcastle and 4-0 losses to Hull and Sunderland. Tan blamed Mackay for relegation, which was confirmed at the penultimate game of the season, and expected a swift Premier League return under the Norwegian. And so began a big recruitment drive in the summer. Nine players came in, many of Mackay's men left, but it seemed even with so many new faces Solskjaer didn't know what his best team was. He named a different starting 11 for all of the games he oversaw this season and his tinkering was deemed to have had an adverse effect on results. Two home defeats in succession, against Norwich and Middlesbrough, sealed his fate. The nature of the capitulation against the Canaries caused particular concern, Cardiff leading 2-0 before conceding four second-half goals to lose 4-2. During the 1-0 loss against Boro four days later, the Cardiff crowd vented their frustration at the Norwegian, booing him as he tried to get the ball to one of his players to take a throw-in. After the game the Norwegian said he accepted the blame for the club's poor run of form. \"I'm responsible and I should get better results than we've had in the first seven games,\" said Solskjaer, who seems to have the ability to remain upbeat in the most trying of circumstances. The manager may be responsible for the team but many feel the board, and particularly owner Vincent Tan, have to take some responsibility too. \"It was the wrong appointment for Cardiff and the wrong club for Solskjaer,\" said former Cardiff captain Jason Perry on BBC Radio Wales. \"Do we know how Cardiff City play? No. \"I think only four players played against Blackburn [in the Championship opener] that played against Middlesbrough. He picked a different back four yet again. \"If you're manager or a coach you have a central strategy and you work on that.\" Solskjaer will not have the chance to find a strategy that works and attention now turns to the next man to work under Tan. Early favourites include Welshman Tony Pulis, who would be popular with fans given the job he did at Crystal Palace last season, and Dundee's Paul Hartley, who has overseen his club's rise to the Scottish Premiership.

The Belfast-born musician, whose full name is George Ivan Morrison, will be known as Sir George. He described his new title as a \"huge honour\". Some of the 69-year-old star's biggest hits include Brown Eyed Girl, Moondance and, fittingly, Here Comes the Night. His knighthood has been granted for \"services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland\". In a statement on Friday, Morrison said: \"Throughout my career I have always preferred to let my music speak for me, and it is a huge honour to now have that body of work recognised in this way. \"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have supported me on my musical journey.\" Morrison was born into a working-class family in east Belfast in 1945 but his exceptional talent has made him a global recording star. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"one of the greatest singers of all time\". The son of Harland and Wolff shipyard worker, he grew up in a small terraced house in Hyndford Street, in the shadow of the shipyard's famous cranes. His father's extensive record collection exposed the younger Morrison to a huge range of American musicians, including Hank Williams, Ray Charles, and Muddy Waters. Those early influences filtered into Morrison's own eclectic style which mixes soul, blues, jazz and country music with pop and rock. As well as selling millions of records worldwide, he has won six Grammys and a Brit award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. His relationship with stardom and the media has not always been comfortable. In 1993, he became the first living recipient not to attend his own induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, more recently he has accepted other accolades in person, including honorary degrees from both of Northern Ireland's universities. Last year, he was granted the freedom of his native city and celebrated the honour by playing a free concert at Belfast's Waterfront Hall.

{"text": "David McIlveen, who is still a member of the party, said Mrs Foster had \"seriously misjudged\" public anger. Mrs Foster set up the RHI scheme in 2012, but its lack of cost controls has left NI taxpayers with a \u00c2\u00a3490m bill. A DUP spokesperson said she continued to receive \"overwhelming support\" within the party and beyond. \"Former MLA David McIlveen is entitled to his personal opinions, however, this is the first time that he has articulated any view since losing his seat,\" they said. On Wednesday, the party said the assembly may be recalled next week to approve emergency legislation to deal with the overspend. Mr McIlveen, who is the son of Free Presbyterian minister and close friend of the late Rev Ian Paisley, Rev David McIlveen, questioned Mrs Foster's handling of RHI in an article for the News Letter. He suggested Mrs Foster was personally responsible for turning the scheme into an \"omnishambles\" and said she will come under increased pressure from her own party. He drew comparisons with the treatment of former DUP leaders Peter Robinson and the Rev Ian Paisley. Mr McIlveen wrote that Mrs Foster was now \"deeply damaged\" and unlikely to lead the party into the next election after becoming an \"electoral liability\". \"Does a party obsessed with elections want to move forward with a leader who appears incapable of facing up to their mistakes?\" he asked. \"The RHI scandal was most likely driven more by a desire to curry favour with the rural electorate than anything more sinister. \"Whilst the view in public is that Arlene's team are as loyal and happy as ever, the reality in private is something very different.\" The party's East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson dismissed Mr McIlveen's comments. He asked what was more credible: \"The views of one individual who will have his own motivations, or the views of the vast majority of party members who have publicly come out and given their support to Arlene Foster. \"I think that I am maybe in a better position than David McIlveen to make an assessment of the view within the party.\" However, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Mr McIlveen's intervention was \"significant\". \"I know you were reporting it as David McIlveen breaking ranks and that is true, but equally true is that he is joining the ranks of those pointing the finger of blame,\" he said. \"And we're not talking about bit players here, David McIlveen was an assembly private secretary for Arlene Foster, he's joining Jonathan Bell who was a junior minister and also a minister for the department of enterprise.\" Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster's treatment of Jonathan Bell, who in December, made a series of allegations about the DUP's involvement in the scheme. \"When one of her own party members broke rank to express their concern about the scheme, rather than approach the issues raised with a listening ear, the default position was to attack the personal integrity of the individual raising the concerns,\" he wrote. \"In any other context, Jonathan Bell MLA would be called a whistleblower. \"Upon witnessing the way in which he was treated by the leadership of the party I do not see how any member of the public who sees something going wrong in the civil service would feel inspired to raise issues with a DUP-run department, upon witnessing how their own people are treated.\" Last month, Mrs Foster said she had \"felt intimidated by Jonathan Bell\" during an RHI meeting, claiming he had \"used his physical bulk to stand over me in quite an aggressive way\". Mr Bell had claimed that Mrs Foster was verbally \"abusive\" and angrily \"overruled\" him when he tried to close the scheme. Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster for branding some of her RHI critics as \"misogynist\", saying that \"rather than facing critics on the level of their political arguments yet again it descends to the personal\".

Allegations that hundreds of women were groped, robbed and intimidated at Cologne's central station on New Year's Eve emerged in January. Victims described chaos outside the city's main station, as the men - some of whom were identified in an official report as migrants or asylum seekers of North African and Arab origin - carried out dozens of attacks with little apparent response from the authorities. Mr Farage claimed women could be at risk because of \"very big cultural\" issues between British society and migrants if the UK voted to remain in the EU, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Asked whether mass attacks on the scale seen in Cologne could happen in Britain, he replied: \"It depends if they get EU passports. It depends if we vote for Brexit or not. It is an issue.\" The UKIP leader made the comments ahead of a live TV debate on ITV on Thursday. During last year's TV general election debates, Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming foreign HIV patients were costing the NHS \u00c2\u00a325,000 each per year. \"The nuclear bomb this time would be about Cologne,\" he told the Telegraph. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Rather than backing her fellow Brexit campaigner's comments, Tory MP Ms Leadsom told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I don't like that sort of campaigning at all.\" \"However we know for a fact that there was an appalling experience for women over in Germany over the Christmas period. \"I do not approve of that sort of campaigning, I do not believe in outright blatant scaremongering so I think it's really, really regrettable. \"I haven't seen it and I wouldn't support suggesting if you vote to remain you'd be raped.\" Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexit campaigner, also refused to associate himself with Mr Farage's comments. \"He's made those remarks and I haven't made remarks like that and I won't make remarks like that,\" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. Sal Brinton, president of the Liberal Democrats, said Farage had \"sunk to new depths in his scaremongering with these remarks which are completely unacceptable\".

Mr Cameron's ally, Chancellor George Osborne, took aim at the UKIP leader in an interview published in the Sunday Times. \"This is a battle between Farage's mean vision of Britain and the outward-facing, generous Britain that the mainstream of this country celebrates,\" he said. \"I say: we don't want Farage's Britain. That means voting to remain.\" Meanwhile former PM Sir John Major hit out at the \"squalid\" and \"deceitful\" campaign to get Britain out of the EU.

But its chief executive, Dr Evelyn Gillan, said the licensing process was too removed from the people and neighbourhoods most affected by the boards' decisions. She said: \"Licensing boards have an important role in trying to minimise the harm that alcohol can cause because they have the power to control how much alcohol is available in their areas. \"The good news is that some boards are working well with the police and health professionals, declaring more areas of overprovision and actively seeking the views of local communities in licensing decision-making.\" However, she added: \"There is a lack of transparency about how the evidence of alcohol harm presented to licensing boards by health, police, and local people has been listened to and acted upon.\" The number of alcohol licences in Scotland has remained broadly static in recent years, according to government figures.

Members found time to lodge 51 questions and motions - 28 of them from Willie Rennie on the China agreement. There was controversy about the issue during the election campaign. It emerged during the election period that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had signed the memorandum, potentially worth up to \u00c2\u00a310bn of investment, with SinoFortone and China Railway No 3 Engineering Group. At the time, Lib Dem leader Mr Rennie called for the agreement to be torn up after a parent firm of the engineering group had been blacklisted by Norway's state pension fund over fears of \"gross corruption\". Fears have also been voiced about human rights abuses. Ms Sturgeon said no firm investment plans had been made and insisted that due diligence would be carried out, although a UK advisor to the Chinese firms said specific projects had been discussed and claimed Ms Sturgeon wanted work to begin \"this year\". Mr Rennie lodged a total of 28 questions, all on the topic of the China agreement and government memoranda of understanding. He asked a series of questions about whether government officials were aware of the Norwegian blacklisting, their assessment of the firm's human rights record, what advice was taken before signing the memorandum, and whether the government would suspend the memorandum until it had investigated concerns. The Scottish Parliament website indicated that the questions were likely to be answered on 26 May. Ms Sturgeon has previously said that \"if there were any concerns that said these were deals we should not do, then we wouldn't do them\". A number of other MSPs also lodged questions on their first day back at work after the election. Labour MSP Neil Findlay submitted three motions, one of them on the \"growing number of Scottish citizens identified as being involved in undercover policing scandals\". His motion calls on the UK government to extend the Pitchford inquiry into undercover policing into Scotland, and says that if it does not, the Scottish government should set up an inquiry of its own.

It later emerged that the man had previously been convicted for child sex offences. Officials say they have now managed to reach the couple, but have no major concerns at present. The contact follows days of speculation over the couple's whereabouts. In a separate discovery, nine babies were found in a Bangkok flat, with a lawyer claiming they were all surrogate babies fathered by a Japanese businessman. Child protection officers reached the Australian pair after trying for the past few days. Western Australia Child Protection Minister Helen Morton told Fairfax Radio on Thursday: \"We've had telephone contact with the family and we're in the process of putting other arrangements in place.\" The department had no \"major\" concerns at present, but would consider how to ensure the safety of the baby girl, Gammy's sister, she said. She urged the media to give the family \"privacy and confidentiality\" in the meantime, adding that at this stage there was no evidence of anything illegal about the surrogacy arrangements. According to court documents, the man was convicted in the 1990s for the sexual assault of several young girls. However, his adult son, who did not wish to be named, told local media that the man was a \"good father\" who had changed. \"He's just got a massive heart. He's made mistakes, we've accepted it... he's made up for them,\" he said. The case of baby Gammy has made international headlines and caused uproar in Australia. Besides Down's syndrome, the six-month-old has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection. Surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua, who has been looking after Gammy, said the couple had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the child's condition four months after becoming pregnant. She said she refused, as it was against her Buddhist beliefs. Abortion on the grounds of foetal impairment is illegal in Thailand. Ms Chanbua, 21, has said the father met the twins, but only took care of the girl. The parents have told local media in Australia that they did not know of his existence, and claimed that the allegations made by Ms Chanbua are lies. Meanwhile, Thai authorities say they have found six boys and three girls, all aged two or younger, in a condominium in Bangkok. The children were accompanied by several nannies and a pregnant woman. A Thai lawyer told police he was representing a Japanese man, who was father to all the surrogate babies, telling the Bangkok Post that the surrogacy arrangements were all legal.

{"text": "A species of midge was able to release large volumes of nutrients into the soil, changing the way native species had lived and evolved, a UK team found. They added the species was well-suited to thrive in the extreme conditions. Details of the research were presented at the British Ecological Society's annual meeting in Birmingham. A team from the British Antarctic Survey said the invasive species, the non-biting midge Eretmoptera murphyi, effectively removed one of the brakes on the way that the native community had developed. \"In terms of function, their job is litter turnover - they help things decay in the soil - and the population density of this thing in the area where it has been introduced is responsible for more litter turnover than the community that was already there,\" explained co-presenter of the research Peter Convey, of the British Antarctic Survey. \"So basically it is bringing a function into an ecosystem that is not very active already. In principle, it can be a fundamental change in the way that ecosystem works.\" Speaking to BBC News before the presentation, Prof Convey warned: \"If you widen [this issue] beyond this particular species then probably the biggest risk is that we could drive locally or generally extinct some of the unique species that already exist in part of the Antarctic.\" He said that in a different project, the team had been looking at the tiny flies' evolution. \"Its native home is sub-Antarctica in South Georgia, and it has been on [the island] for several tens of millions of years. \"South Georgia is its own tectonic plate that has been moving away from South America for 30 or 40 million years. \"The Antarctic peninsula is another tectonic plate of a similar sort, and there are things on there that have got a similar multi-million, if not multi-tens of million-year histories.\" But Prof Convey explained that just because the two areas were located in a similar region, it did not mean the transfer of species between them did not have lasting consequences. \"You are looking at almost distinct bio-geographic regions, which have got their own distinct biodiversity. \"So if you transfer things between them - you have things like this fly that is pre-adapted - you also bring potentially new functions into the ecosystem.\" The threat of introducing a growing number of invasive species into the Antarctic's long-isolated ecosystems is increasing; the team highlighted that about 5,000 scientific staff and 30,000 tourists were visiting the continent each year. Prof Convey said: \"When people visit the Antarctic - whether that be tourists or people like me - we stop in the sub-Antarctic first, then we go on. So the biggest perceived risk at the moment is that people get a lot of mud on their boots, and then two days later you are in the South Orkney Islands, mud drops off boots - so the things are able to colonise the area. \"And then another day later, the ship reaches Elephant Island, which is at the tip of Antarctic peninsula, and then another day later it has got half-way down the peninsula. So you have got this potential step-carrying of things down the peninsula.\" Because species like the midge had the physiological characteristics to survive \"all the way down the peninsula\", it had the potential to have a wide and lasting impact, he observed. \"If we are not careful about the way we move around then we could be a very good carrying vector.\"", "summary": "An invasive species of tiny fly has had a \"fundamental change\" in the Antarctic ecosystem, scientists say.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states that the invasive species has had a \"fundamental change\" in the Antarctic ecosystem, but the text only states that it *can* bring a fundamental change, not that it already has.

{"text": "Two years ago, that border comprised two parallel dirt tracks, one on the Bulgarian, one on the Turkish side. Now a razor-wire fence, 1.5m (5ft) thick, welcomes would-be migrants. Thirty kilometres is already completed, while 100km more remains under construction. \"The purpose of the fence,\" says Philip Gunev, deputy interior minister, \"is to divert flows of migrants towards border crossing points where our limited financial resources allow us to protect European borders in a more efficient way\". Such official checkpoints, he insists, are safer for asylum seekers than trudging long distances, often with small children, over the rough, hilly terrain the fence now cuts across. Fixed and mobile cameras, mounted on four-by-four vehicles, complete the picture along the whole length of the border. In the past eight years, since joining the European Union, Bulgaria has spent \u20ac300m (\u00a3215m) of mostly EU money, reinforcing this border. Another \u20ac100m is available to complete the job until 2020. Only \u20ac2m will be received for the better integration of refugees in the same period. Krassimir Kanev, director of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights advocacy groups, is unhappy with the checkpoints. \"The only way to get through is to pay smugglers,\" he says, arguing that only the richer migrants get a chance to try. \"And there's nothing safe about being cramped in the hidden compartment of a truck in the heat of summer.\" About one third of Bulgaria's migrants are caught on the border with Turkey, another third as they head north or west inside Bulgaria, and the rest on the Serbian or Romanian borders, as they try to continue their journey towards Hungary on their way to Germany. Bulgaria has one of the highest rates of granting refugee status in the EU. Refugee status means they also receive a Convention Travel Document (CTD) and under the 1951 Refugee Convention they can travel on to anywhere in the EU and stay for up to 90 days. In practice, few ever come back, travelling to Germany or elsewhere. At the Harmanli refugee camp in south-eastern Bulgaria, two police buses bring more asylum seekers. Children wave happily, adults look more concerned. Conditions here are much better than they were in 2013, when overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions, and the alleged cruelty of guards gave Bulgaria a bad name. Some asylum seekers still express frustration at delays with their applications. A group of men hold up a snake they killed in the camp the day before. But most acknowledge a big improvement in conditions for the 1,600 refugees here. Bulgaria is facing growing pressure from Western governments to identify exactly who they do let in. Ninety percent arrive with no documents whatsoever because they were taken by the smugglers who brought them this far. In an upstairs room at Harmanli, officers from the Bulgarian intelligence services cross-examine the refugees, most of whom are Syrian Kurds. While Harmanli is an open camp, those deemed suspect are taken to a prison at Busmantsi, near Sofia, where they can be detained for up to a year, while more investigations are carried out. \"The most frustrating thing about life there was the waiting,\" said one former Busmantsi inmate, who asked not to be named. \"Your whole life is waiting.

The shortest waiting time was in Terminal 4, where it took four minutes for passengers from the EU to clear the checks and two minutes for non-EU nationals. BAA said on Friday the longest wait passengers had was 77 minutes at Terminal 3, 75 minutes at Terminal 4, and 54 minutes at Terminals 5 and 1, with non-EU passengers facing the longest wait at the time.

He said: \"It's the UK's reputation and BAA's that suffers. There's no need for it. \"It's entirely about the level of resourcing the government needs to put in place.\" A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said: \"We will not compromise border security but we always aim to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to meet demand.\" She said there were extra workers at the border over the Easter period.

The letter, dated 21 March, said waits in excess of an hour might deter tourists from returning to the UK. The government sets BAA targets for processing departing passengers through security but no contractual service level agreements are in place for arriving passengers, said Mr Baugh. He said the Home Office sets an \"aspirational\" waiting time of no longer than 45 minutes for non-EU passengers and 25 minutes for EU passengers.

Middlesex, also aided by Toby Roland-Jones' 3-81, chose to not enforce the follow on, despite being 212 ahead. Sam Robson hit 77 and Nick Gubbins 64 as the hosts declared on 239-3, and Essex ended 19-0 chasing 452 to win. Given the forecast for rain on the final day, the decision not to put Essex back in to bat again was surprising. However, Robson and Gubbins built on their first-innings centuries to ensure the best chance for victory possible if the weather holds out. After dismissing former England captain Alastair Cook cheaply on day two, Roland-Jones took his third wicket of the match with the 14th ball of the third morning, as Ravi Bopara was caught at third slip, continuing his poor batting form this season. That brought Wheater to the crease, and alongside Lawrence the pair dragged Essex away from a disastrous reply to Middlesex's 507-7 declared, but Wheater was eventually out to a brilliant one-handed tumbling catch by Stevie Eskinazi at square leg to reduce the visitors to 253-6. Ryan ten Doeschate (20) was then trapped plumb lbw by Tim Murtagh, Simon Harmer hit a wide ball to Eskinazi's hands, and Lawrence and Neil Wagner were dismissed by Finn (4-51) as the final four wickets tumbled in nine overs. At a pace of more than six runs an over, Middlesex thundered to a lead of 451, thanks to Robson, Gubbins and fellow first-innings centurion Eskinazi, who hit 62 in 34 balls, going to his fifty with three successive sixes into the Grand Stand off Jamie Porter.

She says everything went according to plan until an agent told her about two hours after she had checked in and received her boarding pass that the flight was overbooked and she did not have a valid ticket. Despite showing her travel documents and getting the tour company to email her trip receipt to prove her ticket was valid, the flight left without her. \"It was extremely upsetting,\" Ms Russell told the CBC. \"The woman could not have been more rude, hostile.

One survivors' group said it was \"indicative of a crisis\" in the inquiry which is examining allegations of child abuse in residential accommodation. Andi Lavery, spokesman for the survivors' group White Flowers Alba, said victims were rapidly losing confidence in the inquiry's credibility. And Alan Draper, from In Care Abuse Survivors, said survivors were \"at a loss\" to understand what was happening. He told BBC Scotland: \"There is concern that the inquiry is dominated by the legal profession, without any balance from other professional groups who have a detailed knowledge of child abuse and its impact and implications for survivors and their families. \"Survivors are considering withdrawing from this whole process until they are satisfied that survivors are placed at the centre of the inquiry. \"The inquiry is about what happened to them and the failure of the establishment to protect them from harm. This failure is continuing.\" The probe is due to report in late 2019. Mr Houston said a \"change in priorities\" in his working life meant he had applied for positions at the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and the Disclosure and Barring Service. \"I have now been successful in those applications and the appointments have been made,\" he said. \"Lady Smith and I have discussed the potential that at some future time, a perception of conflict of interest may arise between these appointments and my work as a panel member on the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. \"After careful consideration of both the time commitment required to fulfil these new roles and the potential, however small, for perceptions to arise of conflict of interest, I have tendered my resignation to the inquiry.\" Mr Houston added that he had been \"honoured\" to be appointed to the panel. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he had accepted the resignation of Mr Houston and thanked him for his positive contribution. \"I know this was not an easy decision for him to reach, but he can be very proud of the contribution he has made to the establishment of the Child Abuse Inquiry and to ensuring its continuing progress,\" he said. In July 2016, senior judge Lady Smith was appointed as the new chairwoman of the inquiry following Ms O'Brien's resignation. A successor to Mr Houston will not be appointed to the inquiry so Lady Smith will continue as the sole panel member. The Scottish government said this brought it in line with other public inquiries established in Scotland under the 2005 Inquiries Act. The abuse inquiry has been plagued by problems since it was set up in October 2015. More than \u00c2\u00a33.5m has been spent on it during this period.

The QC complained of government interference in the inquiry which she said had \"undermined\" her. But the Scottish government denied it was interfering with the inquiry and Lady Smith has also since insisted the investigation will be fully independent.

Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave. Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure \"that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work\". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work. Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination. If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked. However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law.

About one in five children in the England is classed as obese by the end of primary school, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The self-regulatory body, CAP, which sets rules for UK advertising, said the new rules could make a \"meaningful contribution to tackling this important health issue\".

{"text": "The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, says the 16 million fares currently on offer are \"baffling\" for passengers. It wants to ensure passengers are offered the cheapest possible fares. The trial, starting from May, will initially benefit people travelling between Scotland and south-west England. A traveller buying an off-peak return from Wick, in northern Scotland, to Par, in Cornwall, can currently pay up to \u00a3342.50, although in practice few people pay that amount. However, by buying six separate fares for each leg of the journey, passengers can pay as little as \u00a380 for the same trip. That would involve buying tickets from Wick to Inverness, Inverness to Edinburgh and Edinburgh to Par. The RDG says the potential saving of \u00a3262 will soon be offered to customers automatically. CrossCountry Trains, the main operator taking part in the trials, may eventually offer savings on other routes as well. Passengers travelling between London and Glasgow, or London and Edinburgh on Virgin Trains, will also benefit from clearer pricing. Operators currently have to offer a return fare between these cities, which is regulated by the government. But the RDG says it would be more transparent - and possibly cheaper - for commuters if single fares were regulated instead. It wants more booking of single fares - at ticket offices and ticket machines, as well as on the internet. Ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"We're determined to overhaul the system to cut out red-tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines,\" said Jacqueline Starr, RDG director of customer experience. The trial will also see the removal of some historic fares which do not make sense. Ben Morris, business reporter . In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket. Today's scheme aims to make those savings available to everyone. At the moment passengers travelling between London St Pancras and Sheffield pay extra to travel via Grantham, for example, even though it takes longer. Such fares date back to the pre-privatisation era of British Rail. News of the trial was welcomed by passenger groups. \"What's clear from our research is that passengers find the ticketing system far too complex,\" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus. \"The presence of cheaper fares that are 'hidden' in the system really damages trust between passengers and train companies.\" However Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, said more needed to be done. \"It's quite simple. When you book a rail ticket, whether it's in a station or online, people should be given the cheapest price available at that time for their chosen journey. \"These changes will not make that happen. While it is certainly a move in the right direction, people cannot have the confidence that if they book a ticket, they will be paying the best price,\" he said. The price of average train fares - including regulated and unregulated tickets - went up by 2.3% in January, even though consumer prices rose by just 1.6% last year.

After two days of heavy falls following the vote, shares spent two days recovering, and on Wednesday, the FTSE 100 ended above the level it had closed at last Thursday. However, the FTSE 250 index - which contains more UK-focused companies - still remains well below its pre-referendum level. \"The blue chip [FTSE 100] index is stuffed full with big international firms and it is these companies propelling the rise.

The Treasury said Scottish ministers had been advised of the tax situation before setting up national services. Most other police and fire services in the UK are regional bodies and do not have to pay VAT. The issue arose because Scotland's policing and fire services were previously controlled by local councils, which can claim back the tax - but the new national forces set up in 2013 are controlled by the Scottish government, which cannot. Mr Mackay said the police and fire services were struggling with the \"unnecessary\" burden of tax which they \"simple should not have to pay\". He said: \"This is a significant sum which other emergency services do not have to meet. \"There is a significant difference in the way VAT affects emergency services across the UK, with Scottish police and fire services paying VAT when other territorial services in the UK do not have to. \"There needs to be a level playing field for such essential services. \"As we continue to invest in our emergency services we will continue to press the UK government for Scottish emergency services to have the same ability to recover VAT as all other British and Northern Irish Forces.\" Scottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur said it was right that the VAT position was \"reconsidered\", but said the Scottish government should not use that as a \"smokescreen\" for its own failures.

The 2.4m euros (\u00c2\u00a31.8m) boat was built in England and is the smallest, fastest and lightest in the RNLI fleet. The boat was designed by Peter Eyre from Londonderry who was rescued by a Lough Swilly lifeboat when he was 14.

{"text": "US researchers say the slow-is-more-accurate rule generally applies. In a series of calculations, they looked at the physics behind releasing a projectile with the human arm. Their equations suggest a slow underarm throw is the best strategy for getting a piece of paper into a nearby bin. Lead researcher Madhusudhan Venkadesan, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Yale University, said faster throws tend to be less accurate. This is because the ball travels in a nearly straight line, so any errors in the angle at which the object is released tend to be amplified. In slow and curved flight paths, small errors in the angle of release have little effect, he said. \"What we find is that almost the slowest arc is often the most accurate,\" said Dr Venkadesan. \"We've compared these calculations to published data of people throwing into wastebaskets; we've compared it to a study in dart throwing.\" In sports such as basketball or darts, the strategy depends on conditions and the trade-off needed between speed and accuracy. For example, experienced darts players throw overarm at about 5.5 metres per second, optimally releasing the dart 17 to 37 degrees before the arm becomes vertical. On the cricket pitch, fielders are more likely to strike the wicket with a fast underarm throw. And in basketball, the underhand free throw, nicknamed \"the granny throw\", has a marginal advantage over overhand, despite almost disappearing from the game. Accurate throwing is uniquely human - a skill relied upon by our ancient ancestors for hunting with spears or stone tools. The researchers say monkeys also throw things, but they are really bad at it. The study is published in the journal, Royal Society Open Science.

He had been awarded custody of Alexa-Marie in December 2013 - three months before he killed her.

The jury was told that psychiatrists diagnosed Wheatley with multiple mental health disorders.

Both Jess Phillips, Labour, and Maria Miller, Conservative, said they were concerned by the case and would write to the attorney general. Bashir's ex-wife said she was \"disappointed\" by the judge's comments. At Manchester Crown Court, Bashir of Hebers Court, Middleton, Manchester, admitted two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Judge Richard Mansell said his decision on the sentence was guided by the fact he was \"not convinced [Bashir's then wife] was a vulnerable person\" as she was \"an intelligent woman with a network of friends\" and a degree. Despite acknowledging the attacks had an \"ongoing effect\" on his victim's ability to trust people, he sentenced Bashir, who played cricket for Oldham, to 18 months, suspended for two years. Speaking to the BBC, which has agreed not to use her name, Bashir's ex-wife said she was \"disappointed in the comments which the judge made about my vulnerability\". She added: \"I am a confident and strong woman because of what I have suffered. I was suffering for my life but the judge didn't believe me.\" The judge also ordered Bashir to attend a workshop entitled ''building better relationships'', pay \u00c2\u00a31,000 costs and banned him from contacting his ex-wife indefinitely. Ms Phillips, who is MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the judge's comments sent a \"dangerous\" message. \"Your vulnerability and your risk is a completely dynamic thing,\" she said. \"Everybody has a dynamic risk, I've met women who went on to be murdered who had law degrees, who were very eminent business people. \"There's no category that domestic violence does not touch. It does not follow class lines, it does not follow race lines, it does not follow age lines.\" Ms Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told the BBC: \"The brutality of the sort of acts that have been outlined really make me believe that this was a devastating episode in the victim's life. \"I do think this needs to be properly understood by judges and it needs to be properly accounted for in sentencing.\" An apparent defence claim, noted by the judge, that a prison sentence would have lost Bashir a contract with Leicestershire County Cricket Club (LCCC) has been rejected by the club, which denies it has ever been in contact with Bashir.

{"text": "Organisers campaigning to save Lewisham Hospital say the plans are \"crazy and ill thought out\". Under proposals, its A&E will close and the maternity unit be downgraded after neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust ran up debts of \u00c2\u00a3150m. The government said \"doing nothing is not an option\" and is to make a decision on 1 February. Campaigners are angry Lewisham Hospital, which is not part of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, is being targeted in a re-organisation of services across the area following the trusts's financial problems. Under the plans, the trust's Queen Elizabeth Hospital site in Woolwich would come together with Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to create a new organisation. Lewisham's A&E unit would then be downgraded to an urgent care centre, meaning emergency cases would be seen at nearby hospitals. The maternity unit at Lewisham could also be slimmed down, meaning complex cases would be dealt with elsewhere. South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs three hospitals, was placed in administration last year when it started losing about \u00c2\u00a31.3m a week. The problems it faces are not unique. Last year it was reported 20 trusts had declared themselves financially unsustainable in their current form. Matthew Kershaw, a special administrator, said in a report to the government that the trust should be broken up, with other organisations taking over the management and delivery of services. If implemented fully, Mr Kershaw said his recommendations would result in a radical overhaul of services in south London, and help deliver \"safe, high-quality, affordable and sustainable services.\" Mr Kershaw also recommended the Department of Health (DoH) write off any debts to ensure new organisations were not \"saddled with the issues of the past\". \"I have said consistently that the status quo is not an option, and I believe these final, refined recommendations are the right ones, although I appreciate that some people will find them difficult to accept,\" his report said. In November thousands of people marched in protest at the plans and BBC London reporter Matt Morris said at least 15,000 attended Saturday's event. The Save Lewisham Hospital group said 25,000 took part. Dr Louise Irvine, a local GP and chairman of the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign, said: \"This decision is crazy and ill thought out. \"It is a big mistake and carries huge clinical risks of things going wrong for patients but also political risk. \"If Jeremy Hunt can close a good local hospital here, he can do it anywhere in the country - nowhere is safe.\" A DoH spokesman said: \"Where trusts face long-standing problems we have been clear that doing nothing is not an option.\" The march went past Lewisham Hospital and ended with a festival in nearby Mountsfield Park.", "summary": "Thousands of people have taken part in a rally against plans to close a south London hospital.", "human_descriptions": ["The hospital isn't being closed, only reorganized/downgraded."], "split": "dev", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 1100}
{"text": "The prime minister said he appreciated people were \"disillusioned\" with the EU and he \"absolutely understood and received the message\". He told the BBC that only Conservatives offered a referendum on UK membership. The BBC's Nick Robinson said this \"simple message\" instilled confidence for many within the party. UKIP gained 23 MEPs, with the Tories having 19, behind Labour which has 20. The Conservative share of the vote was 23.9%, behind Labour on 25.4% and UKIP on 27.5%. Some Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the performance and Mr Cameron said he was \"disappointed\" for the MEPs - including its former leader in Brussels Martin Callanan - who lost their seats. But he said the vote reinforced his belief that the UK's relationship with the EU needed to change. \"I take a very clear message from the election. People are deeply disillusioned with the EU. They don't feel the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change. \"I would say that message is absolutely received and understood.\" While he was an instinctive \"reformer\" who, in the referendum would \"give the choice to the British people of whether to stay or go\", Labour backed the \"status quo\" in Europe and the Lib Dems did not want any change. Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that UKIP's victory was a snub for the Westminster elite in general and for Mr Farage's different campaigning style, saying the UKIP leader was a \"consummate politician\" who was already discussing tactics for the 2015 general election. He again dismissed any talk of pre-election pacts, at either a national or constituency level, saying he was \"100%\" focused on delivering an outright Conservative victory.

Activists fear they have been detained by Chinese officials. The Foreign Office said it was \"deeply concerned\". The disappearances have sparked fury from lawmakers and activists in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, adding to growing unease that freedoms in the city are being eroded, the BBC's Hong Kong correspondent Juliana Liu said. Mr Lee is the latest bookseller to go missing, after raising the alarm about four of his colleagues at publishing house Mighty Current, who disappeared in October. He disappeared last week and was last seen in Hong Kong. A letter faxed to his bookshop, apparently written by Mr Lee, says he travelled to China on his own and is fine. Activists believe the letter is genuine - but was written under duress. However, Mr Lee's wife, Sophie Choi, has withdrawn her request for police to help find him saying he has been in contact. She had previously told the BBC she was \"really afraid\" about his whereabouts. The 'unprecedented' case of the missing Hong Kong bookseller . Hong Kong bookstore disappearances shock publishing industry . Speaking at a news conference in Beijing alongside his counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Mr Hammond said he had raised concerns about Mr Lee's whereabouts. \"These people have gone missing. A Mr Lee Bo, who is a British passport holder, has gone missing and we have urgently enquired both of the Hong Kong authorities and of the mainland Chinese authorities what if anything they know of his whereabouts,\" he said. Mr Wang told journalists the missing bookseller was \"first and foremost a Chinese citizen\", while the Chinese foreign ministry has said other countries had \"no right to interfere\". But Mr Hammond said that any charges against Mr Lee should be dealt with in Hong Kong, not mainland China. \"Our view is that the Basic Law, the joint declaration, the principle of One Country Two Systems means that in a question of any breach of Hong Kong laws the question must be settled in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong judicial system.\" Mr Lee's disappearance has sparked an outcry in Hong Kong, where some suspect he may have been kidnapped and illegally transported across the border to mainland China - in a process akin to extraordinary rendition. Activists believe he may have been detained because of a book about the private life of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The BBC's correspondent in Beijing, Steve Evans, said the booksellers had been publishing \"pretty scurrilous stuff about mainland Chinese politicians\" which was freely available in Hong Kong, but had been seeping over into mainland China. If they have been snatched by the Chinese authorities, that would represent a breach of the guarantees made by China to Britain when Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, he said. \"It matters for Hong Kong, because if there is perceived to be an erosion of the rule of law, that throws into doubt the whole basis on which this system of one country, two economic systems, is upheld,\" he said.

{"text": "The Information Commissioner is to be asked to overrule a decision by the National Archives to keep the documents about the trial of Stephen Ward hidden. The submission is being made by lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. It is believed Ward killed himself as his trial for living off immoral earnings was ending. Ward, an artist and osteopath living in London, had in 1961 introduced 21-year-old reputed call girl Christine Keeler to the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. The minister and Ms Keeler - who is also thought to have had relations with an attache at the Russian embassy, Yevgeny Ivanov - started an affair. When challenged, Profumo initially denied the relationship - but was later forced to admit that he had lied in March 1963, in a scandal that threatened to topple the Conservative government of the time. Ward, who many believe was a victim of a cover-up, is understood to have killed himself on the last day of his trial at the Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Ms Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, who were referred to at the time of the court case as prostitutes. Mr Robertson, the author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK, said that he was making the appeal because keeping documents about Ward's trial hidden \"was irrational and ignores the public interest and the interests of history in discovering the truth about Ward's conviction, which is widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice\". He added: \"Releasing the official trial transcript is important to work out why Ward was ever prosecuted, and it will assist the case for overturning his conviction.\" The National Archives refused Mr Robertson access to most of its file on Ward, which is believed to include the police statements used to charge him with living off the earnings of Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies. Mr Robertson argues in his book that neither woman was a prostitute, and both in fact lived off Ward's earnings as a celebrated osteopath and portrait artist. The file on Ward is currently closed from public view until 2046, because this is 100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses. The Information Commissioner is set to make a decision to see if it can be opened earlier. According to Mr Robertson, this \"will cast an important new light on one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern British history, and help explain how Stephen Ward was made the scapegoat for the Profumo affair by prosecuting him for crimes that neither he nor anyone else ever committed\".

Mr Corbyn, who insisted on Thursday that he could defy the polls and \"change the direction\" of the election, has used Labour analysis of Department for Education figures to focus on education. He said: \"The prime minister herself has said that super-sized classes are proof of a school system in a crisis. \"And that's what we've got on the Tories' watch. \"School leaders and teachers have said Tory cuts to school budgets will mean class sizes will be forced to grow even larger.

He told supporters: \"500,000 children in England - half a million children - are now being taught in super-sized classes of over 36\". The half a million figure is for class sizes of 31 - 34. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn had mixed the figures up. A Conservative spokeswoman dismissed Mr Corbyn's comments and pointed out that the number of infants in large classes had risen by 18% in three years in Wales. \"Of course we are not complacent about the situation in England,\" she added. \"There is more to do and that's why we are spending a record amount on schools - something we can afford to do because of our careful management of the nation's finances.\" Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Friday, Mr Farron will challenge Tory MPs who supported staying in the EU to oppose a so-called hard Brexit.

Two people were killed and five police were injured in attacks on a free speech debate and a synagogue. The gunman was later shot dead by police. He did not appear to be part of a wider terror cell, Denmark's PM said. Earlier on Monday, two men were charged with providing and disposing of the weapon used in the attacks and helping the gunman to hide. The gunman was named by local media as Omar El-Hussein. The national flag flew at half-mast on official buildings across the capital on Monday. Floral tributes have been placed by mourners at the site of the two attacks. Some also put flowers at the place where police shot the suspect dead. One told Danish TV2: \"I did it because I am Muslim and because I knew him.\" As dusk fell on Monday a vast crowd gathered for the Copenhagen event, held on a square near the cultural centre where one of the attacks took place. A police spokesman said the crowds numbered about 30,000. Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt told the audience that an attack on the Jews of Denmark \"is an attack on Denmark, on all of us\". She also again vowed that Denmark was determined to safeguard its values. The prime minister earlier told a news conference the attacker was a Danish-born man aged 22. \"He was known by the police for several criminal acts, including severe violence, and he was also known to be linked to a criminal gang in Copenhagen. \" \"But I want to also make very clear that we have no indication at this stage that he was part of a cell.\" Omar El-Hussein: homegrown radical . The two suspects being held by police appeared in a closed custody hearing on Monday. Michael Juul Eriksen, a defence lawyer for one of them, said they denied the charges. Omar El-Hussein was released from prison two weeks before the attacks after serving a sentence for grievous bodily harm. Danish intelligence chief Jens Madsen acknowledged that El-Hussein had been \"on the radar\" of his services. Mr Madsen said investigators were working on the theory that he could have been inspired by the shootings in Paris last month. The attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, a kosher supermarket and a policewoman claimed 17 lives. In the first of the two shootings on Saturday, at a free-speech debate in the east of the city, film director Finn Norgaard, 55, was killed. In an audio recording of the shooting, the gunman can be heard interrupting the debate and firing dozens of shots. Hours later, Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old long-time member of the Copenhagen synagogue, was shot dead while on security duty outside the building. Eighty people were celebrating a girl's bat mitzvah, or coming of age, in a hall behind the synagogue at the time. The gunman fled by car but was traced by police to the city's Norrebro district. He opened fire when confronted and was fatally shot by officers. In another development, controversial cartoonist Lars Vilks - who believes he was probably a target of one of the attacks - says he has gone into hiding. He told Channel 4 News he was now in a \"secret place\". Finn Noergaard, 55, was struck in the chest by a bullet at the free speech debate. The documentary film-maker had a keen interest in the problems faced by the offspring of migrant communities. His friend Malene Trock told Berlinske daily he was \"open-minded\" and \"cosmopolitan\". Producer Torben Larsen is quoted by the AP news agency as saying Mr Noergaard was \"a very generous and warm person\". Dan Uzan, 37, was shot dead while standing guard at a Copenhagen synagogue.

{"text": "In 1787, the 28-year-old Robert Burns was suddenly a \"celebrity\", according to Prof Nigel Leask, regius chair of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow. The 2nd Edinburgh edition of his poems had given him a quite a handsome pot of money and it had also made him famous, with the cream of Scottish society taking an interest in him. Prof Leask says: \"He was the lion of Scottish literature, everyone wants to meet him.\" And Burns also wants to meet them, especially if they have the power to promote his work further and the cash to buy his books. \"Poets in the 18th Century depended on patronage so he tours around the gentry and nobles, really doing a bit of salesmanship,\" says Prof Leask. Throughout 1787 Burns embarked on a series of tours, firstly around the Scottish Borders and northern England and then further afield to the west Highlands taking in Inveraray, Arrochar and dinner with Glasgow tobacco merchant George Buchanan at Arden House at Bannachra near Loch Lomond. Later in the year he toured the Highlands during which time he stayed with the Duke and Duchess of Atholl at Blair Castle, dined with the Duke and Duchess of Gordon at Castle Gordon and visited historical sites such as the Culloden battlefield and Cawdor Castle, which featured in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Prof Leask says that Burns seems to have had letters of introduction from Edinburgh patrons that gained him access to the upper-echelons of Scottish nobility. \"He's not overawed by his posh surroundings,\" says Prof Leask. \"It shows his amazing social versatility. He's got an ability to move in all the circles of society. \"There is a sense of how thoroughly he was in the society and culture of the late 18th Century.\" Prof Leask says: \"It slightly qualifies the image of the 'heaven-taught ploughman' who does not have formal qualifications, who is just a genius endowed by nature. \"This shows how learned he was, how much he knew.\" Prof Leask says the tours of the Highlands are also important because it was a Lowlander's encounter with Gaelic culture, the Highland culture of Scotland. During his travels he composes songs like the Birks of Aberfeldy and discovers his east coast heritage, visiting relatives in Stonehaven and Laurencekirk. His father's family had a strong connection to the Jacobites in the north east. As well as mixing with the Scottish nobility there was plenty of time for the rock star antics for which Burns has become well known. Prof Leask recounts how Burns stopped for the night at Arden House near Loch Lomond. \"He has a very convivial night of dancing and drinking and seeing the sun rise over Ben Lomond,\" says Prof Leask. \"He sets off the next day and has a horse race on the road down to Dumbarton with a Highland man he calls Donald, who is riding an unharnessed horse and Burns is riding Jenny Geddes, his old mare. \"He is determined not to be overtaken so he races and has an accident. \"It's a bit like two boy-racers on the A82 nowadays.\" The tour journals are included in the new \"Oxford Edition of the Works of Robert Burns: Commonplace Books, Tour Journals and Miscellaneous Prose\".

The DWP figures also show that in 2015-16, rises in pensioner incomes stalled. A number of reports and previous data have shown that income growth has been faster among pensioners than working-age people since the financial crisis. This has led to widespread debate over the future of the triple-lock - a promise made to pensioners that the state pension will rise in line with prices, wages or 2.5%, whichever is highest.

Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy at Royal London, said: \"While there are clearly some pensioners who enjoy good company pensions and have benefited from house price inflation, there are clearly also many who are not in such a fortunate position. \"Any change to policy on state pensions need to take full account of the diversity of experience of pensioners in Britain today, and not simply assume that pensioner living standards will keep on rising.\" For all UK households, the median average income rose by \u00a38 in a year to \u00a3481 a week before housing costs in 2015-16.

The high-resolution video unit should provide a resolution on the ground of about 1m per pixel. Large crowds and moving vehicles would be visible on this scale. The second camera will provide static imagery at a medium resolution of 5m per pixel. \"Testing of every part of the camera system will now follow.

Skybox Imaging of San Francisco has already started to showcase video of Earth acquired by its small, free-flying SkySat-1 satellite. And Planet Labs, another San Francisco venture, has a \"flock\" of 28 nano-satellite imagers that are about to be released out of the airlock on the ISS. The station itself is increasingly becoming a platform for Earth observation. This is quite a challenge, however. The movement of the astronauts inside the ISS makes it flex, and there is a constant vibration from onboard equipment. All this requires cameras to have dampers built into their rigs to maintain a steady shot. The US space agency (Nasa) will be launching another two Earth-observing instruments to the station this year. One will study ocean winds and storms; the other will examine small particles in the atmosphere that can influence the climate.", "summary": "Two Earth observation cameras have been attached to the International Space Station.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "dev", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 211}

He had bruises and hypothermia from outside temperatures as low as -41C, Austrian media reported. He survived because the plane flew at a low altitude to avoid stormy weather. The man apparently got under a fence at Schwechat airport in Vienna and climbed into the undercarriage of the first plane he saw without knowing its destination. The plane belonged to a sheikh from the United Arab Emirates and had been standing empty on the tarmac at Schwechat airport since Thursday.

{"text": "It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry. He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'. But one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India. At the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes. And the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention. The reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent. This week Greenpeace won a small victory. On Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad. In January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India. But the war is far from over. The charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO. A secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity. It said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate. Greenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy. Coal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production. It is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change. And, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights. China's coal use of coal has been falling steeply, helping stall world growth in CO2 emissions. Meanwhile India's CO2 emissions are forecast to rise rapidly. According to the International Energy Agency, India is set to double its coal consumption by 2035 and become the world's largest coal importer by around 2020. Almost half of the 1,200 new coal-fired power stations proposed around the world are in India according to the World Resources Institute. That's why campaigning against the coal industry in India has been a priority for Greenpeace. The charity's campaigns have stopped coal mining in some of India's forest areas. The NGO will also have earned the government's ire by its relentless attack on two of India's corporate behemoths, Coal India and the Adani Group. Coal India is the biggest coal company in the world and India's fifth largest company. The Adani Group is the third biggest coal company in world and its head, Gautam Adani, is known to be close to the Indian prime minister. But the Indian government's attempt to muzzle Greenpeace and other NGOs has generated a chorus of criticism. India likes to celebrate its status as the world's largest democracy but the American ambassador to India has said its harassment of NGOs had a \"chilling effect\" on the nation's democracy. When the Indian electorate voted Mr Modi into power with a handsome majority a year ago they were voting for his promise to transform the Indian economy. Mr Modi is clearly determined to deliver on that promise. Indeed some Indians now fear that he may compromise some of the country's other core values along the way.", "summary": "Narendra Modi is sitting down with a group of Chinese business leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary mentions Prime Minister Modi's first name is Narendra, which is true, but the source text doesn't mention the Prime Minister's first name.", "The summary mentions that the Prime Minister will meet with Chinese leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.

Mrs O'Neill will have just five weeks to prepare for an election after Stormont's power-sharing coalition fell apart over a botched energy scheme scandal. The fallout from the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, which is approximately \u00a3490m over budget, led to Mr McGuinness' quitting after DUP leader Arlene Foster refused to stand aside as first minster while an investigation was carried out. As they hold a joint office, his resignation automatically put Mrs Foster out of her job and prompted the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Mrs O'Neill described her new role as \"the biggest honour and privilege of my life\". \"I have never been afraid of challenge and I have never been afraid to act,\" she added. She referred to her first act as health minister last year, when she ended Northern Ireland's blanket ban on gay men donating blood. Mr McGuinness said he was \"overjoyed\" at her appointment, which he said was part of a \"generational change\" within his party. He said that as health minister she had already taken on one of Stormont's toughest portfolios, adding that Sinn F\u00e9in did not appoint people to such ministerial posts unless they had the \"all-round ability to manage very difficult situations\". Tackling mounting hospital waiting lists has been a huge task for Mrs O'Neill since she was appointed health minister last May. In October, she launched a 10-year plan to transform the health service, saying it would improve a system that was at \"breaking point\". Opposition politicians questioned the lack of details in the plan, which was not costed. But it set out a range of priorities, including a new model of care involving a team of professionals based around GP surgeries. Mrs O'Neill was first elected to the assembly in Mid Ulster in 2007 and has held various senior positions within Sinn F\u00e9in. She has worked for the party since 1998, initially as political adviser to MP and former MLA Francie Molloy, before being elected to Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council in 2005. In 2011, she was appointed as minister for agriculture and rural development. The following year, she announced the department would move to a former British army barracks in Ballykelly, County Londonderry. After the announcement, it came to light that Strabane had been chosen as a more suitable location by an internal DARD assessment, a decision that Mrs O'Neill then overruled.

Ms Malhotra resigned as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury last month in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership and is now backing leadership challenger Owen Smith. In a statement, Ms Malhotra said staff working for Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell had gained \"unauthorised entry into my office in parliament\". The MP for Feltham and Heston described several incidents when people from the leader's office used digital keys to open the office door. \"The implications of this are extremely serious,\" she said. \"This is a breach of parliamentary privilege and is a violation of the privacy, security and confidentiality of a member of parliament's office. \"Furthermore, my staff, including an intern, who have always been courteous and open, have felt harassed, intimidated and insecure and decided themselves it would be best to not leave anyone alone in the office.\" She has complained to Mr Bercow and to Mr Corbyn and called for a formal investigation.

She accessed the office in question to confirm when it would be vacated. \"It is a month since Seema Malhotra resigned as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, and the office is intended for the person holding that position.\" BBC political correspondent Carol Walker said the incident was \"another extraordinary twist in Labour's increasingly bitter internal battle\". The complaint comes after more than 40 female Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn saying he had failed to do enough to prevent \"disgusting\" threats against members. The group of female MPs - including former shadow ministers Heidi Alexander, Paula Sherriff and Kerry McCarthy - say intimidation has been carried out in Mr Corbyn's name. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Corbyn condemned abuse among members, saying \"it has no place in our party\". He said: \"I don't do personal abuse, I don't respond to personal abuse, I condemn any abuse from others.\" Meanwhile, leadership rival Mr Smith said his wife, Liz, had been a victim of online abuse and claimed there was now a level of abuse, anti-Semitism and misogyny in Labour that was not there before Mr Corbyn became leader. \"My wife stood recently for a community councillor position in the village where we live in South Wales and was subject to a torrent of online abuse. It's a community council position.\" He added: \"I think it's just absolutely unacceptable.\" Mr Corbyn is facing a challenge from the former shadow work and pensions secretary, after Labour MPs overwhelmingly backed a motion of no-confidence in their leader.

In a statement read by the coroner, she said she found Mr Brown with an injury that was \"not survivable\". The train from Gatwick to London Victoria was travelling at about 60mph when the incident happened near Balham, south London. Mark Young, from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), told the hearing Mr Brown's head was out of the window with no evidence to indicate why. He said Mr Brown suffered a fatal head injury as a result of striking a signal gantry. Ms Duffield said she saw Mr Brown had collapsed in the corridor after she stood up from her seat, but saw he was still breathing. \"There was a lot of blood on the floor and around his head. There was a massive trauma to the top of his head,\" she said. She said it became apparent there was nothing she could do for him. The inquest heard Ms Duffield got off the train at Wandsworth Common after the alarm was raised and the driver had been alerted. She said she saw \"blood splatter\" on the outside of the carriage, but had not seen Mr Brown with his head out of the window. Mr Brown's mother, Jane Street, said her son had a passion for railways and \"was neither reckless nor ignorant of the dangers of that environment\". In a statement, she said her son first volunteered on the Bluebell Railway as a nine-year-old and had recently become an engineering technician with Hitachi Rail Europe in Bristol. Mr Brown's father, Mike Brown, said his son had been due to move in with his girlfriend and he had \"never seen him so relaxed, happy and enthusiastic about his future\".

He played for just over an hour of Saturday's friendly and Rodgers reckons that was enough to show how vital he will be. \"His range of passing, it makes the game look very simple,\" Rodgers added. \"He can play short, play long, he can dribble and shoot. \"He has everything to be a top, top level number eight.

{"text": "BitTorrent Sync uses peer-to-peer technology to send information between users' PCs. It eliminates the need to upload data to a third party's computer servers, as is the case with services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive. But one analyst said businesses were unlikely to be tempted by the idea. Davies Murphy Group's Chris Green said companies would worry about their lack of control over the new process even though it did not rely on a third-party's data centre to update what might be sensitive files. But he said it might appeal to some members of the public for private use. BitTorrent is an eight-year old San Francisco-based company offering a range of free-to-use products designed to make it easy and quick to send large files over the internet. They work by co-ordinating the process so that devices downloading material also share small pieces of already-accessed data with others in order to share the load. Although the technology has become associated with media piracy due to its use by some media-sharing sites, BitTorrent itself is a legal company that makes money by licensing its technology and brands to business customers. It began testing the new tool at the start of the year. The facility is categorised as alpha - signalling it is still being tested and may be unstable - but the firm announced on its blog that it was now ready to invite the public to try it out. It suggested users might find it quicker and more private than the alternatives. \"Since Sync is based on P2P [peer-to-peer technology] and doesn't require a pit-stop in the cloud, you can transfer files at the maximum speed supported by your network,\" it said. \"Your information is never stored on a server in the cloud; your data is protected by encrypted keys. Your files belong to you, and stay on the devices of your choice.\" To prevent unauthorised access to shared data, the software generates a private key for each synched folder on the original device. This is made up of at least 32 characters and must be entered into all the other devices to which the information is sent to in order for the files to be accessible. One of the benefits of synching software is that it allows a user to ensure any changes made to a document on one machine are copied to all their other devices. In its current state, BitTorrent Sync achieves this by noting the change and then copying the whole updated file to other computers, replacing any earlier version. This means it may be less efficient in some cases than some of the cloud-based services that can detect which parts of a file have been changed and only copy over those bits of the data. However, BitTorrent has indicated that it too hopes to introduce \"differential sync\" later this year. The technology has the potential to disrupt the nascent file-synching industry. Although Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, Apple, SugarSync and others offer a limited amount of free storage on their services, they make money by charging customers who need to transfer and synch large files such as video footage or lots of smaller documents. However, Mr Green suggested the earlier cloud-based technique could ultimately prove superior. \"One of the reasons why Dropbox and Google Drive use central servers as middle-men between your devices is that the server plays an important role in ensuring the most recent version of the document gets pushed to each device and doesn't overwrite more recent updates. \"When you are working on a straight device-to-device peer-to-peer method like this it's a lot harder to ensure that safety net. \"However, there's obvious appeal for some people who like the idea of not being beholden or reliant on a third-party who may have technical problems or go bust taking all their data with them.\"", "summary": "The company behind the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol is inviting the public to try out a new version of its software.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states that the company is inviting the public to try out a new version of its software, but the text does not mention that this is a new version of existing software.

The charity said Rotherham should be \"a wake-up call for Scotland\". The Scottish government said it was committed to protecting children and young people's wellbeing. Revelations of child abuse on a massive scale in the English town were revealed in the Jay Report. Now Barnardo's Scotland has published 15 lessons it said must be learned by those involved in protecting children and young people in Scotland. The charity said child sex exploitation (CSE) \"is happening across Scotland\", with two large-scale police operations to identify victims and target perpetrators, one of which, Operation Dash, was ongoing. Barnardo's called for recognition, at every level, that sex between an adult and a child under 16 was always wrong and that it was not the child's responsibility to say 'No'. Martin Crewe, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: \"We know child sexual exploitation is happening across Scotland. \"We know how devastating it can be. We know charities and support agencies are aware of the problem and are working to put the necessary infrastructure in place to tackle child sexual exploitation. \"But as part of this process, we all need to heed the warning and learn the lessons from Rotherham if we are to be certain that we are all doing our best to protect children from this horrific form of abuse in Scotland.\" He added: \"If there is one fundamental lesson from Rotherham it is that we cannot be complacent about child sexual exploitation in Scotland.\" Police Scotland said keeping children safe, particularly those who are vulnerable, was top of its list of priorities. As part of Operation Dash, 22 people have been reported to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in relation to a range of crimes.

{"text": "Taking comfort from the fact that, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the UK leads the world for care of people in the final weeks of their life is perhaps a more appropriate reaction. The UK topped the table when the EIU last carried out this exercise in 2010. But the number of countries included has been doubled to 80 in this latest survey, commissioned by the Lien Foundation of Singapore. So for the UK to again lead the pack, including all other wealthy nations, is significant. In essence, the UK scores so highly for the care of patients nearing the end of their life because the NHS is such a well-integrated service. Health professionals, ranging from hospital doctors to GPs and community nurses, generally work together effectively to ensure patients receive the end of life care they might expect. This includes pain management through palliative care. This is not the case in many international healthcare systems. The report praises the UK for having a comprehensive strategy with the NHS working alongside the hospice movement and charities such as Marie Curie and Macmillan. Ensuring that people get to live out their final days in a place of their choice is an area where there has been progress in recent years. Its interesting that both the report authors and other experts in the field have gone out of their way to stress there is still plenty of scope to do better. The Health Ombudsman in England recently highlighted cases where people were badly let down and experienced death without dignity. Future demand, the report says, is likely to be higher as people live longer and the burden of cancer, dementia and diabetes increases. While noting the report's findings are \"very encouraging\", the Health Minister Ben Gummer said the Government was determined to go even further to ensure patients and families were involved in decisions about care. The crossbench peer Baroness Finlay has introduced a Palliative Care Bill which will be debated in Parliament this month. The aim she says is to guarantee all patients equal access to services around the clock and regardless of geography. But she acknowledges that, helped by each of the UK's health administrations having a strategy, there has been improvement. \"We are vastly better than we were - patients are rating good services very highly though the problem is gaps in provision at ground level,\" she says. The hospice movement, she told the Today programme is \"setting a gold standard and leading the world\". Its important to give praise where praise is due. In this sensitive area, its easy to assume from anecdotal reports that the NHS could do a lot better. So to score more highly than Australia and New Zealand, as well as Germany, France and the US is highly commendable. Richer nations inevitably lead the pack with the Philippines, Bangladesh and Iraq propping up the table. Affordability of care, with a taxpayer funded health service, is predictably a lot more bearable for British patients than in other economies. The NHS, the hospices and a range of dedicated professionals should be given a pat on the back. Specialist training and expertise is highlighted by the report, along with successful national policies.

The career CPS lawyer has overseen some of the country's most important prosecutions and is currently the organisation's London chief. The DPP is the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, responsible for more than 6,800 staff. By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News . The role of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is critical within the criminal justice system of England and Wales. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is the organisation that can deliver justice by making independent decisions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, and when it decides that there is, by prosecuting the case effectively. It works closely with the police but must always be seen to make independent and dispassionate decisions based upon the evidence gathered.

She then briefly left the CPS to join government as a deputy legal adviser to the attorney general. On her return, she set up the CPS organised crime division which deals with complex cases including human trafficking, drugs, counterfeiting and money laundering across borders. In 2009 Alison Sanders was named chief crown prosecutor for London, which deals with more than 200,000 cases a year. She oversaw the successful 2012 prosecution of two of the men who attacked and killed Stephen Lawrence in 1993.

Eric Pickles is considering a request by campaigners for a full environmental assessment before the area is razed. The street is one of several known as the Welsh Streets, which were built in the late 19th Century when there was an influx of Welsh people who came to Liverpool to work as dockers. At a planning meeting at Liverpool Town Hall earlier, residents of the streets pleaded with the council to knock down what they called \"damp slums\" and replace them with modern homes. Opponents of the demolition said the streets had historical importance to Beatles fans as well as potential tourist value. The childhood homes of John Lennon - Mendips, in Menlove Avenue - and Sir Paul McCartney - in Forthlin Road - are preserved as tourist attractions supported by the National Trust. George Harrison's Arnold Grove childhood home remains a private house. A request for the Madryn Street house to be put under a preservation order was turned down by English Heritage last year, which ruled the property had no associations with the success of the Beatles as a group.

He said: \"A majority of the local community have expressed support for our plans since we started consulting on this plan over a decade ago. \"They are sick of living in poky, damp infested properties.

Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has denied that the school misled students. But Hillary Clinton described the venture as a \"fraudulent scheme\". Mrs Clinton, who leads to race to be the Democratic nominee, said the former school was \"used to prey upon those who could least afford it\". The now defunct for profit school is at the centre of two class-action lawsuits in San Diego, California, alleging the company scammed students by failing to deliver on promises to impart Mr Trump's secrets of real estate success. Former students say they were misled by adverts claiming Mr Trump had \"hand-picked\" teachers and \"overseen\" the curriculum. The billionaire businessman continues to maintain the majority of his customers were satisfied with the real estate programme. The documents were released following an order by US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel. The judge ruled that the files were in the public interest since Mr Trump had become \"the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race\". Trump University was launched in 2004 as a business venture under the Trump brand, offering courses in entrepreneurship. The extent of Mr Trump's involvement in the scheme is a key point on contention. The trove of documents include manuals or \"playbooks\" for employees outlining how to \"close the deal\" and convince students to invest in business seminars that cost up to nearly $35,000 (\u00c2\u00a324,288). The \"playbooks\" also advised sales staff on how to speak to reporters, how to dress and run Trump University events, as well as how to identify students with the most liquid assets. The unsealed files also included depositions from executives describing how the operation worked. They also included statements from employees describing the program a \"scam\". Former staff member Ronald Schnackenberg wrote that he left Trump University in 2007, citing the program used \"misleading, fraudulent and dishonest\" tactics. The previously unseen testimony from Trump University executives goes some way to show Mr Trump's level of involvement in the school's marketing strategy. Michael Sexton, Trump University president, said in a 2012 deposition that Mr Trump offered \"very good and substantive input\" to the program's marketing materials. The documents were released in one of two class-action lawsuits in California against Trump University. In a separate civil lawsuit in New York, Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has alleged that Trump University used deceptive practices and misled students about the support they would get.

Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, an ally of the Congress party, and Maharashtra's Prithviraj Chavan were also \"heckled by BJP supporters\" at different functions. Newspapers and websites feel such incidents are dangerous for India's federal structure.

The article says that \"at first blush, this may seem like a minor spat driven by political ego\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it underlines a certain Jekyll and Hyde quality that Mr Modi's leadership has acquired...\" \"It's just bad precedent that will, in the end, undermine Mr Modi's own credibility when he talks of working with the opposition - or when he visits an opposition-ruled state and can't find a single chief minister who will share a stage with him,\" it adds. Following the incidents, several Congress leaders have declared that they will no longer share stage with Mr Modi. The Tribune says such anger is \"manufactured\" and is \"directed only at the rival party's chief ministers\". \"The BJP is well aware that any protest in the presence of the PM would get wide publicity and thus serve the party's political strategy of creating an anti-Congress wave [in the upcoming state elections],\" it says.

{"text": "It was opposed to the ICC trying Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on charges of crimes against humanity, said Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. The AU would raise its concerns with the UN, he added. Mr Kenyatta, who was elected in March, is due to be tried in July. He denies the charges, which arise from accusations that he fuelled violence after disputed elections in 2007. Analysts say the charges bolstered his campaign in this year's poll, as many voters saw the trial as interference in Kenya's domestic affairs. He beat then-Prime Minister Raila Odinga by 50.07% to 43.28%, giving him a narrow victory in the first round. Speaking at the end of an AU summit in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, Mr Hailemariam said the cases of Mr Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto should be referred to the Kenyan courts. African leaders were concerned that out of those indicted by the ICC, \"99% are Africans\", Mr Hailemariam added. \"This shows something is flawed within the system of the ICC and we object to that,\" he said. The ICC had been formed more than a decade ago to end the culture of impunity, but \"now the process has degenerated into some kind of race hunting\", Mr Hailemariam said. It was \"chasing\" Mr Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, despite the fact that the rival Kalenjin and Kikuyu ethnic groups, who had fought after the 2007 election, had come together to vote for them in the March poll, he added. \"The AU is mandated by the assembly [of the AU] to take care of this issue, to present to the UN the core of this matter,\" Mr Hailemariam said. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were on opposite sides in the 2007 election, after which some 1,000 people were killed and 600,000 people fled their homes. The trial of Mr Ruto, who faces similar charges as Mr Kenyatta, was due to begin this month but it has been postponed. A new date is yet to be set. The ICC insists that it acts impartially, and says it intends to press ahead with the case against Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto. Source: ICC factsheet . Kenyan lawyer Wilfred Nderitu, who represents about 150 victims of the violence, told BBC Focus on Africa he was concerned about the safety of witnesses if Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were tried in local courts. He also doubted whether Kenya's judiciary was capable of dealing with such complex cases, he said. \"A lot of judges don't have an international criminal justice background. Therefore, the technical expertise will be lacking,\" Mr Nderitu told BBC Focus on Africa. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir attended the summit, in defiance of an ICC warrant for his arrest. It was unreasonable for the UN Security Council to refer Mr Bashir to the ICC when three of its five permanent members - the United States, Russia and China - had either not signed up to or not ratified the Rome Statute which established the ICC, said AU Peace and Security Council head Ramtane Lamamra, Reuters news agency reports. \"How could you refer the cases of others while you don't feel compelled to abide by the same rule?\" he is quoted as saying. The ICC has charged Mr Bashir with genocide over the conflict in Darfur. He denies the charge, and accuses the ICC of being a tool of Western powers. Around 300,000 people are estimated to have died in Darfur since 2003, according to the UN. Earlier this month, Kenya's government wrote to the UN Security Council, asking for Mr Kenyatta's and Mr Ruto's trials be halted. The prosecution was \"neither impartial nor independent\", said the letter, signed by Kenya's UN Ambassador Macharia Kamau. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were the \"glue\" that held the country together during the March poll, the letter added. The UN Security Council is able to defer ICC cases for up to 12 months.

The inhabitants of the Sinai Peninsula, notably some of its Bedouin tribes, are a heavily armed force that, it would seem, the military rulers of Egypt who had recently stood down were reluctant to challenge. Now, in one of those bitter paradoxes of power in the Middle East, it has fallen to Mohammed Morsi, the recently elected president from the Muslim Brotherhood to clamp down on militants who claim Islamic legitimacy for their attacks. It might be argued that Mr Morsi is the ideal man to take these wayward tribes in hand - since he has both a democratic mandate and some degree of backing from Egypt's religious establishment. There is also a good deal of cynicism in Cairo about the tribes' professed religious motivations, since they are also widely believed to be involved in smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people. Even so, Tuesday's raid on Touma, close to the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean Sea, may indicate the opening of a bloody new chapter for Sinai. The raid, in which helicopters fired missiles into the township, had an aspect of communal punishment about it, or reprisal for Sunday's loss of border guards. Inevitably there will be some who want revenge against the security forces. Since the armed bands on the peninsula are thought to possess hundreds of light weapons, as well as technicals (pick-up trucks mounting heavy machine guns), and multiple rocket launchers they have considerable ability to cause trouble. The bombing of several hotels in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005 claimed 84 lives was blamed by security officials on elements within the same Bedouin tribes, claiming ties with al-Qaeda. It underlines the degree to which the country's Red Sea tourist industry is vulnerable to reprisals. More recently the Israelis have accused the same groups of several deadly attacks along their border with Egypt. These created great tension in an area that had been peaceful for decades, and prompted the Israelis to start building a barrier through the desert in an attempt to prevent more infiltration. Today the Israelis have reacted with satisfaction to the new security crackdown, and have given their agreement to military reinforcements going into Sinai (as it required under the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries that sought to de-militarise the peninsula). Mr Morsi meanwhile faces the accusation that has been used in the past against those who have taken similar measures, of acting as Israel's policeman. The shooting of so many Egyptian soldiers at the weekend has allowed the president to present this action as a response to a challenge to national authority rather than an attack on Israel. But the scope both for serious escalation in this violence and for political difficulties for the new president will make the Sinai Peninsula a key place to watch in coming months.", "summary": "Egypt's decision to launch a military operation against militants in the Sinai Peninsula is a brave one.", "human_descriptions": ["the summary adds info not found in the source: the commentary about the decision being a \"brave one\"."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3585}

{"text": "With more than 40 firms now offering gas and electricity deals it warns of the danger of one becoming insolvent. At present anyone who is in credit with their energy supplier could lose out. The watchdog wants the cost of a safety net to be paid for by customers, which would have \"a small impact on bills\", it said. Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, Rachel Fletcher, said: \"\"We are proposing a safety net to protect customers' credit balances in the unlikely event of a supplier failure.\" Under current rules, if a gas or electricity supplier becomes insolvent Ofgem appoints a replacement to ensure that customers continue to be supplied with energy. But it warns that \"there may be financial implications for the failed supplier's customers\". That is because as direct debit energy payments spread the cost evenly across the year, customers are often in debit during the winter and build up credit in the summer. Ofgem reckons that a typical customer's credit balance peaks at a little over \u00c2\u00a3100 each year. But it warns that without regulatory intervention, customers are unlikely to receive all - or possibly any - of their money back if their supplier fails. Some industries already have a financial safety net for consumers. If a financial services firm goes bust, for instance, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme protects people's savings with authorised firms up to \u00c2\u00a375,000. The scheme is paid for by a levy on all financial services companies. Meanwhile if a travel company collapses, customers are protected if it was a member of travel trade association ABTA. The scheme is funded through a bond on members. Ofgem wants similar protection for energy customers and is proposing to allow, on a case-by-case basis, the costs of reimbursing credit balances to be spread across all energy customers. \"This would better protect customers' money and have a small impact on bills,\" it said. The watchdog was keen to stress that it does not expect any suppliers to go out of business. \"These proposals are for reassurance and to give customers the confidence to shop around and get the best energy deal,\" Ms Fletcher said.

The incident happened in Hebron in the occupied West Bank last March, after another soldier was stabbed. Sgt Azaria said he thought Sharif might have an explosive vest, but prosecutors said his motive was revenge. The high-profile trial has proven extremely divisive in Israel, says the BBC's Yolande Knell in Tel Aviv. There have been rallies to support the soldier and some senior politicians backed Sgt Azaria. However, top military figures were quick to say that his actions did not reflect the values of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). In the incident on 24 March, Sharif and another 21-year-old Palestinian, Ramzi Aziz al-Qasrawi, stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier before troops opened fire on them, wounding Sharif and killing Qasrawi. Footage of the scene several minutes later, filmed by a Palestinian and released by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, shows Sharif alive. A soldier, identified as Sgt Azaria, is then seen cocking his rifle and fatally shooting Sharif from several metres away. In their indictment, prosecutors said Sgt Azaria \"violated the rules of engagement without operational justification as the terrorist was lying on the ground wounded and represented no immediate threat for the accused or others who were present\". Delivering the verdict on Wednesday, the panel of three military judges rejected Sgt Azaria's defence that he shot Sharif because he continued to pose a threat. He had told the court that he believed there might be a suicide belt under the Palestinian's jacket. The judges, who took two-and-a-half hours to deliver their verdict, noted that Sgt Azaria's company and battalion commanders had testified that he did not mention the same concerns when they questioned him immediately after the shooting incident. The judges also said there was no dispute regarding the veracity of the statements made by another soldier, who testified to military investigators that Sgt Azaria had told him during the incident: \"They stabbed my friend and tried to kill him - he deserves to die.\" Sgt Azaria told the court that he did not recall having any such conversation, but the head of the judging panel, Col Maya Heller, described him as an \"unreliable witness\". \"His motive for shooting was that he felt the terrorist deserved to die,\" she said. Prosecutor Lt Col Nadav Weissman said: \"This is not a happy day for us. We would have preferred that this didn't happen. But the deed was done, and the offence was severe.\" A spokesman for Sgt Azaria's family said evidence proving his innocence had been ignored. \"It was like the court was detached from the fact that this was the area of an attack,\" he said. The soldier's mother, Oshra, shouted at the judges: \"You should be ashamed of yourselves.\" The defence team has said it will appeal against the verdict. Sentencing is expected in the next few weeks. Manslaughter in Israel carries a maximum 20-year term. Sharif's father Yusri was quoted as saying Sgt Azaria deserved a life sentence. Sharif's uncle, Fathi, told Haaretz that the decision to try him for manslaughter rather than murder was \"a perversion of justice and of the court\". Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who expressed support for Sgt Azaria before taking office in May, said the verdict was \"difficult\" and that the defence establishment would \"do everything it can to assist the soldier and his family\". But he also called on the public to respect the court's decision. Sari Bashi, Israel advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, described the verdict as \"a positive step toward reining in excessive use of force by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians\". The shooting happened during a wave of knife, gun and vehicle ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs in Israel and the West Bank that has killed at least 42 people since September 2015, according to the Israeli authorities.

{"text": "Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead announced the move earlier this month. Almost 30 organisations have signed an open letter seeking an urgent meeting with him to discuss their concerns. Mr Lochhead said the changes would not affect research. Under EU rules, GM crops must be formally authorised before they can be cultivated. An amendment came into force earlier this year, allowing member states and devolved administrations to restrict or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms within their territory. Mr Lochhead announced he would use the amendment to request Scotland be excluded from European consents for the cultivation of GM crops. The letter - whose signatories include the National Farmers' Union, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Roslin Institute and the European Academies Science Advisory Council - said they were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"negative impact\" a ban could have. It claimed the decision was \"political and not based on any informed scientific assessment of risk\". The scientists and academics said outlawing the cultivation of GM crops \"risks constraining Scotland's contribution to research and leaving Scotland without access to agricultural innovations which are making farming more sustainable elsewhere in the world.\" The letter cited examples where \"a GM method has a contribution to make\". It highlighted ongoing research on things which \"might benefit Scotland's farmers, consumers and environment\" including potatoes that can reduce fungicide use and omega-3 enriched oilseeds that may offer a more sustainable source of feed for salmon farming. Responding to the letter, Mr Lochhead said he respected the views of those in the scientific community and would be happy to meet them. He said he would \"reassure them that these changes will not affect research as it is currently carried out in Scotland, where the contained use of GM plants is permitted for scientific purposes, such as in laboratories or sealed glasshouse facilities\". He added: \"However, just because GM crops can be cultivated in Scotland it doesn't mean they should be. \"Scotland's \u00c2\u00a314bn food sector has a reputation for a clean and green image across the world and allowing the cultivation of GM crops could damage that unique selling point.\" Last week, a former chief science adviser to the Scottish government warned on ban on GM crops could have \"apocalyptic\" consequences and threaten the country's food and drinks industry. Prof Muffy Calder, who stepped down from the role in December and has yet to be replaced, said she was \"disappointed and angry\" and called on ministers to publish the scientific basis for their decision. Professor Neva Haites, vice president for life sciences at The Royal Society of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland: \"Most governments try to get the best advice possible before they make these decisions. \"In the past we have had chief scientific advisers such as Dame Anne Glover and Prof Calder, who were there to give advice on such subjects. \"We no longer have such an adviser in government at the moment and the scientific body that usually gives advice has not met for some time. \"So we are suggesting it is time they actually looked again and sought some very senior advice on this subject.\"", "summary": "Scientists and academics have called on the Scottish government to rethink plans to ban the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states that the Scottish government has plans to ban GM crops, but the source text that it is a law that allows them to ban such crops, and it was already announced", "The summary states that scientists and academics have called on the government to rethink, but the source text does not mention any explicit call to \"rethink\" .

{"text": "Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and Gavin Martin Hughes, 31, who are both from Springfield Park in Belfast, appeared in court alongside their older brother Joseph Christopher Hughes, 35, from The Meadows in Downpatrick. The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes. When they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast. Regarding the drugs seizures in October 2013, Gavin Hughes pleaded guilty to five charges, including possessing cocaine with intent to supply. He was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release. His brother Gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in August and October 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years. Half of this sentence will be spent in jail, with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison.

{"text": "Some see in this the potential for a new era in Russian-French relations. Maybe not the strategic alliance of old, but certainly an end to the modern-day chill. Events have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin. For France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing. Today there are more pressing concerns. In the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS. Realities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication. But still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player. As one diplomatic official told Le Monde: \"Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.\" President Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin. First he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS. Second, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad. The French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader. It took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge. But there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack. There are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement. First of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh. This has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is now a designated enemy. Second, Russia has every interest in cultivating Paris as a new friend. Straight after the Paris attacks, Mr Putin ordered his military to co-ordinate with the French in the campaign against IS - an unprecedented act given that France is in Nato. The Russian leader was effusive with compassion, and even sent a dog - Dobrynya - to replace Diesel the French special forces Alsatian who was killed in the raid in Saint Denis. It was all very deliberate, because there is nothing the Russians would like more than to lure the French out of the American-Western orbit. In the geopolitics departments of Russian universities - and some French ones too - this is regarded as a historically-determined necessity. France and Russia, after all, are two great nations lying at either end of the European continent - with a shared interest in preventing its domination either by outsiders (the US) or insiders (Germany). Throughout the last three centuries the two countries have been periodic allies - notably in the run-up to World War One. But also President Charles de Gaulle himself - though viscerally anti-Communist - kept his distance from the Americans by flirting with the Soviet Union. What could be more natural - say Kremlin insiders - than for France to resume its natural role, triangulating between Washington and Moscow? But tempting as this might sound to some in France, there is no geostrategic shift in the offing. For one thing the French do not trust Vladimir Putin. For another, the two countries still have opposing visions on too many key issues. France will never abandon Ukraine. And in the Middle East, France's allies are the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia - not the Shia axis backed by Russia. There is a concordance of interests bringing Paris and Moscow together. With luck, this will help in the battle against IS.

Gwrych Castle was built between 1812 and 1822 by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh as a memorial to his mother's ancestors, the Lloyds of Gwrych. By 1989 it was sold to an American and although there were plans for its future, it began to fall into decline. Travellers moved onto the site for two years before finally being forced to leave in 1997. Mark Baker, now Dr Baker, an architectural historian, said he felt compelled to try to save it after walking by it daily on his way to school. His campaign to set up Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust attracted the attention of the local newspapers and won support of community leaders. Today, the registered charity has a 25-year lease for five acres (two hectares) of the site. This has enabled it to begin restoration of the first section of the castle, the Countess's Writing Room in the Gardener's Tower. Although the formal gardens are regularly opened, from this month visitors can explore the grounds themselves for the first time. Dr Baker said public access had always been his \"main aim\".

{"text": "Charlotte Bevan, who had schizophrenia, walked out of St Michael's Hospital in Bristol in December 2014 with daughter Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck. Their bodies were found in undergrowth in the Avon Gorge days later. The serious case review also found the lack of a lead clinician overseeing Ms Bevan's care led to confusion. The Bristol Safeguarding Children Board's report said there was a system for controlling entry to the ward \"but mothers and babies were allowed free access throughout the hospital\". It went on to say that, \"this allowed CB [Charlotte Bevan] to leave the ward with ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] unnoticed and unchallenged\". The report said once the alarm was raised that Ms Bevan and her four-day-old daughter were missing, there was a quick response. However, it said the safeguarding concerns were \"everybody's business\" as Ms Bevan was \"able to walk outside at night, in unsuitable clothing, carrying a newborn baby, in a public place unchallenged by anyone\". Since their deaths, the report said ward security had been \"reviewed and improved\" and changes had been made to the reception area. Charlotte's mother Rachel Fortune, who contributed to the review, said in a written statement \"no single thing, action or person was to blame\". In the statement, released jointly with her daughter Janet, she said there were eight main findings which offered \"clear, constructive learning\", including how to manage long-term mental health in pregnancy, \"honest, accurate and timely communication\" and how several agencies could work together with a lead clinician. She added: \"This was a particularly difficult case to manage as long-term ill mental health and pregnancy came together. It's our hope now that any families and individuals facing such difficulties will have a multi-agency team with accountable clinicians in each service, as they now do in Bristol.\" The review also found Ms Bevan's explanation for stopping her medication due to breastfeeding concerns was not followed up with a pharmacist until after she had given birth. She later revealed she had not been taking medication for the last five months of her pregnancy, which the review team speculated was a sign of \"disguised compliance\". The report said: \"It is notable that it was not until CB [Charlotte Bevan] had given birth to ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] that any professional contacted a pharmacist to confirm the safety of her medication on ZBM when breastfeeding or otherwise.\" There was also confusion over who was leading, co-ordinating and overseeing Charlotte's overall care, the report found. In some cases, it found, health professionals assumed it was the Mother and Baby Unit Doctor, the mental health care co-ordinator or her GP. The report also found there was confusion over the terminology in describing her mental health condition. It found that describing her as \"well\" meant there was no clarity in what this meant in mental health terms. Independent chair of the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board, Sally Lewis said: \"This review provides constructive learning for many agencies and professionals working in Bristol and beyond. \"A great deal has already changed in local professional practice since this tragic incident, some of which has been influenced by the findings of this review and has been noted by the Board in our formal response.\"", "summary": "A mother and her newborn baby were \"unnoticed and unchallenged\" as they walked out of a hospital, a report has found.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1729}

A BBC correspondent who has flown into Kunduz has heard gunfire and artillery exchanges not far from its centre. Afghan officials say foreign jihadists trained by the Islamic State (IS) group are fighting alongside the Taliban. Provincial governor Mohammed Omer Safi told the BBC that the bodies of 18 foreign fighters, including three Chechen women, had been found. Security forces and Taliban have been involved in a stand-off for about a week after the insurgents launched an offensive on Kunduz at the end of April. The insurgents are currently said to be massed in the Gul Tepa district on the southern outskirts of the city. This is the first positive confirmation by a senior government official that Islamic State is operating alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan. Until now, particularly in the south of the country, IS fighters have often clashed with the Taliban. But the governor said that the battle for the north is different, and here IS fighters are \"supporting the Taliban, training the Taliban, trying to build the capacity of the Taliban for a bigger fight\". And, he said, they were more violent because they wanted to die in battle as martyrs. As well as from Afghanistan's immediate northern neighbours, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, the dead came from Chechnya and Turkey. They were wearing black headbands marked with the same Islamic verses used by IS in Syria and Iraq. Battle heralds militant tie-up . Correspondents say the advance is the most serious threat to a provincial capital in years. Afghan army and police are involved in the fighting but there is no substantial help from foreign troops. The BBC's David Loyn in Kunduz says Afghan forces are thinly spread in this region, and as well as this determined assault on Kunduz the Taliban and their allies have also attacked remote outposts in the mountains of Badakhshan further east. Reports said at least 13 police were killed in the attacks. Governor Safi said the Afghan forces in Kunduz did not have enough air power and their helicopters lacked the armaments they should have. Only a few thousand Nato troops remain in the country, largely in training roles, after their combat mission ended in December. They have turned down several requests to assist with air strikes. People displaced by the fighting are spread across the city and rural areas of the province of Kunduz. The prolonged fighting could lead to a bigger problem if there is a failure to bring in the harvest this month, our correspondent says. Kunduz supplies half of Afghanistan's rice crop, so delays could have a far-reaching impact, he adds.

Payments to existing users are to continue until 2015. Ms Miller said: \"An independent discretionary trust delivering social care is financially unsustainable.\" But Richard Hawkes, chief executive of disability charity Scope, said the decision to phase out the fund was \"bemusing\". \"The fund is comparatively very small and is designed to support disabled people to live at home rather than in care homes,\" he said. \"It's hard to see how phasing out this fund will do anything but narrow down options and push people towards greater dependence on the state.\" The phased closure was described as \"foolhardy and lacking in humanity\" by Labour peer Lord Morris of Manchester. Lord Morris, who was the first minister for the disabled, said: \"This will not save money. If you make it harder for disabled people to live at home, it will cost more because more of them will have to be in hospitals and other places of full-time care. \"It will mean far more of them having to be in institutional care at far greater cost to the taxpayer.\" The government said local authorities had a statutory responsibility to provide social care support to their residents.

{"text": "Gwynedd council is a considering charging a premium on holiday homes. Councillor Jason Humphreys, however, fears the authority will lose out as people sidestep the charge by classing their second homes as self-catering businesses. Gwynedd said it was powerless to stop owners making the change. Some Welsh councils have voted through hikes in council tax charges for second homes, including Anglesey and Pembrokeshire, with other councils still consulting on a change. Since 2006, the number of self-catering units in Gwynedd has risen from 78 to 968. Changes to the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 mean councils have the ability to charge a premium on top of the existing council tax payments for second homes from the 2017-18 financial year. But self-catering units are classed as businesses and so their owners pay business tax to the Treasury rather than council tax. According to the law, self-catering units have to be made available for letting for 140 days a year, and owners have to prove they have been let for at least 70 days. Mr Humphreys, chairman of the council's corporate scrutiny committee, told the Post Cyntaf programme there was no mechanism for monitoring the situation. He called for AMs and MPs to demand a law change to make it compulsory for anyone seeking to reclassify their holiday home as a self-catering unit to apply for planning permission. But Peredur Jenkins, cabinet member responsible for resources, said the council had no power to stop owners from designating their properties as self-catering units. The council previously warned the potential \"loophole\" could leave authorities worse off. Mr Jenkins said Gwynedd was pressing the Welsh Government to consider changing the planning regulations to give local authorities the power to determine whether owners could re-classify their properties. The Welsh Conservatives have criticised the second home tax as an unfair \"money-spinner\", with shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders calling it a \"spiteful wealth tax\". She said it was a \"a direct tax on people with second homes, many of whom already pay twice for services they rarely use\".

It is the first stage in a bid to halt the \u00c2\u00a3160m dual carriageway because of concerns over the impact on wildlife in and around Lough Neagh and Lough Beg. A judge has ruled the challenge should proceed to a full hearing in 2017. The A6 is the main Belfast to Londonderry road and is heavily used. Mr Murphy, an ornithologist, was granted leave in the High Court to seek a judicial review over an alleged breach of a directive on a specially protected area close to a section of the Toome to Castledawson stretch of the upgrade. The A6 upgrade would also run through a landscape made famous by Heaney including an area near Mossbawn, County Londonderry, the former Nobel laureate's childhood home. Mr Murphy said Heaney's work was fundamental to the area's landscape. \"The wild and the wet inspired him and he immortalised it in his work,\" he said. \"You have got dozens of places in his poetry that will be destroyed by the impact of the noise of a motorway so close to Mossbawn\". The environmentalist issued proceedings after the upgrade was given the go ahead by Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard. At Thursday's hearing, a judge said there was still uncertainty surrounding checks to determine the disturbance to wildlife in and around Lough Neagh and Lough Beg. The judge held that an arguable case has been established on an alleged breach of the habitats directive that gives protected status to both Loughs. He noted that further assessments have been carried out since the department first made checks on the presence of nesting birds, badgers and bats, and to ensure minimisation of disturbance to whooper swans. But the judge said he was unclear whether these actions were part of a fulfilment of the habitats directive obligations. \"The court is left wondering about the impact or otherwise of the checks being carried out,\" he said. The judge said that any concerns may be eased once further information is supplied. However, he ruled that the challenge should proceed to a full hearing early next year. \"There's substantial public interest involved in a case like this,\" he said. \"Stopping a major road project is a matter of considerable importance.\" The disputed route for the dual carriageway was identified following a public inquiry nearly a decade ago.", "summary": "A landscape made famous by poet Seamus Heaney could be destroyed by a major road upgrade, a environmentalist has claimed.", "human_descriptions": ["Heaney's first name was not mentioned at all."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3663}

{"text": "Mohammad Javad Zarif told Tasnim news agency that he sent a tweet saying: \"Happy Rosh Hashana\". In a Twitter exchange that followed, he also distanced himself from the Holocaust denials of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It comes amid confusion over whether new President Hassan Rouhani also tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashana\". A message came from a Twitter account thought to belong to Mr Rouhani earlier this week, but officials later said he did not have any such account. Iran has a Jewish community of up to about 30,000, according to some estimates, though much lower than the population which numbered about 80,000 prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution. The fact that Iranian leaders are congratulating Jews on the occasion of Rosh Hashana would not necessarily be controversial, say correspondents, but many in the international community are watching for signs that Mr Rouhani is seeking warmer ties with the West and Israel. Senior politicians are often the victims of Twitter hoaxes, whereby other web users set up fake accounts in their name. But in an interview given to Tasnim and published on Mr Zarif's Facebook page, the foreign minister confirmed he sent the \"Happy Rosh Hashana\" message because of Iran's Jewish community. By Rana RahimpourBBC Persian Service . The timing of these messages on Twitter may signal a shift in Iran's diplomatic discourse. A few weeks ahead of President Rouhani's trip to New York and Iran's first meeting with the IAEA since his election, it seems the new leadership is trying to present a more pragmatic and approachable side to the Islamic Republic. Furthermore, this rare instance of Iran's foreign minister using Twitter to respond to the daughter of a senior politician in the US, a country with which Tehran has had no diplomatic relations for three decades, means Iran is attempting to distance itself from the radical views of the last president. In summary, Iran's new administration appears keen to create a more benign atmosphere for negotiations. He then had a response from Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, who said: \"Thanks. The new year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir\". He replied: \"Iran never denied it. The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" He was referring to Mr Ahmadinejad who, during his presidency, frequently claimed the Holocaust was a lie. \"We have condemned the killing of Jews by Nazis as we condemn [the] killing and crackdown on Palestinians by Zionists,\" Mr Zarif told Tasnim. Mr Ahmadinejad's anti-Israel comments and Tehran's controversial nuclear programme helped contribute to Iran's increased isolation in recent years. Iran has been the target of four rounds of UN sanctions and numerous UN Security Council resolutions calling on it to cease enrichment work amid fears it aims to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to obey, saying it intends to enrich only for power station fuel or other peaceful purposes. President Rouhani on Thursday announced that the foreign ministry would take over nuclear negotiations with the West from the Supreme National Security Council. The move makes it likely Mr Zarif - who has experience living in and negotiating with the West having served as Iran's envoy to the UN - will take over responsibility for the talks.

In early 2014, Murray split with his then coach Ivan Lendl - who'd helped Andy become a Grand Slam champion. His decision to replace Lendl with Amelie Mauresmo prompted more than a few raised eyebrows. Never before had a top male player hired a woman as coach (except for Jimmy Connors but the woman in charge of his game was his mother Gloria, so it doesn't count). The early signs for the new partnership weren't good. Murray appeared to be slipping back into some bad habits, playing defensively and berating himself in the process. Despite a late season surge, 2014 was Murray's most forgettable year since establishing himself as one of the \"Big Four\". Had Murray continued his iffy form into the Australian Open, there's no doubt the vultures would have been circling over the Murray-Mauresmo axis. But they'll have to wait as his early season form is arguably better than ever. His play against Tomas Berdych had Mauresmo's finger prints all over it - full of variety and controlled aggression.

{"text": "In experiments on mice, the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours, without killing normal cells or themselves. Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was \"the future\" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal Stem Cells, was the work of scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr Khalid Shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the results were very positive. \"After doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells.\" He added: \"Cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life.\" But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. \"Now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs.\" Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said: \"This is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. \"It shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. \"Cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be.\" Nell Barrie, senior science information manager for Cancer Research UK, said it was an \"ingenious approach\". \"We urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. \"But so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours.\" She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr Shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults.

Recent data has suggested that China's economic growth continues to slow down. As well as the volatility in Chinese shares, there are fears of a protracted effect on demand for commodities. China's slowdown is expected to pull down other regional economies, affecting energy and raw material consumption. The unstable Chinese market has also led to worries that the problems in the world's second largest economy may have far-reaching global consequences. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index on Monday shed as much as 8%, while markets in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney all dropped by more than 4%. On Friday, figures showed China's factory activity in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years. Official figures have indicated that China's economic growth is continuing to slow. For the three months to the end of July, the economy grew by 7% compared with a year earlier - its slowest pace since 2009. Bernard Aw, market strategist with trading firm IG, said given the tepid demand, it was hard to fathom why oil producers were pumping out more crude. Opec producers, notably Saudi Arabia, and Iraq were producing more oil than necessary, while US stockpiles were nearly 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average. \"At this rate, the fundamentals of oil are going to get worse before it gets better as the supply glut widens. This means we are likely to see more weakness in oil futures in the coming sessions,\" Mr Aw said. Oil dealers are also anticipating revised US economic growth data for the second quarter, to be released on Thursday.

MPs backed a request from the prime minister to hold a snap general election on 8 June by 522 votes to 13. Sinn F\u00e9in's northern leader said Mrs May had shown a \"blatant disregard for the people of the north\". Michelle O'Neill said the prime minister's announcement of a general election was about \"the Tory party's self interest\". Meanwhile, the SDLP rejected any suggestion of her party entering a pact with Sinn F\u00e9in. DUP MP Ian Paisley said the \"deep frost button\" had been pressed on power-sharing talks in Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley expressed concerns about the future of the talks process during the general election campaign. \"We are seeing the freezer bags come out and the deep frost button being pressed on the Assembly,\" he said. In the last general election, in May 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agreed pacts in four constituencies, including the UK's most tightly-contested seat of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. That pact helped Mr Elliott take the seat from Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle Gildernew - she had held on to it by just four votes in 2010. On Tuesday, UUP leader Robin Swann said he was \"open\" to discussion on the issue of pacts. Mr Elliott told the BBC on Wednesday it was important that the \"people of Northern Ireland have representation at Westminster\". He also said talks with the DUP would take place in the days ahead to secure the \"best agreement around some constituencies\". Earlier, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party wanted to \"quickly\" arrange talks with the UUP on a potential pact. Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the DUP was \"prepared to go further\" this time. \"We recognise that - if Northern Ireland is to maximise its representation and to have a strong voice in the absence of our own government - then we need to return MPs who will actually take their seats at Westminster,\" he said. Sinn F\u00e9in currently has four MPs but they do not take their seats in the House of Commons, in protest at British rule in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey suggested there should be a new unionist pact in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and \"other constituencies as well\". The DUP MP highlighted South Belfast as one constituency where the unionists could gain a seat from nationalists by agreeing to stand a single-unity candidate. The seat is currently held by SDLP MP Dr Alasdair McDonnell. However, there will be no reciprocal deal between nationalist parties, according to Dr McDonnell's colleague, South Down MP Margaret Ritchie. Mrs Ritchie told Good Morning Ulster: \"We don't do electoral pacts\". \"The SDLP fights the election - each and every election - on our own mandate and our own basis,\" she said. Speaking on the same programme, Sinn F\u00e9in's national chairperson, Declan Kearney, said his party shared much \"common ground\" with the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party on issues such as Brexit, equality and the legacy of the Troubles. He said parties opposed to a hard Brexit and austerity policies should work together. \"We'll do our best to maximise the Sinn F\u00e9in vote,\" Mr Kearney said. UUP MP Danny Kinahan criticised Sinn F\u00e9in abstentionism. \"At the moment, there are four seats where no-one turns up at Westminster and it is the mother of all parliaments,\" he said.

As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to \u00c2\u00a33.4m.

Now it is quiet. Birds sing, villagers try to move rubble with their hands and, overhead, the hum of high-flying aid helicopters punctuates the air. \"They are flying in the sky, but no-one has come up to now,\" says Prakash Bhandari, who works as a waiter in Kathmandu but returned to see if he could help his home village. \"We are suffering. What to do?\" he asks. Despite having one of the largest casualty figures from Saturday's earthquake, this area has received little or no aid. Villagers say they need tents and food, and that they are worried about disease. They dug up the bodies of the people they knew with their bare hands. But Saturday was a busy shopping day and they think that there are many more people under the rubble that they do not know. \"We will die if there's no help from the government and other organisations,\" says Dhan Bahadur Shresthra who used to run the local pharmacy and was helping patients when the quake struck. \"I worked as a medic in the army for 25 years so I know that if we don't have clean water or food to eat, then there could be an epidemic,\" he says. Further up the hill, villagers have taken matters into their own hands. In a hamlet that is now nothing more than mounds of red earth and wood, 22-year-old Anjali Majhi has hired an excavator to search for the body of her two-year-old daughter. Just before the quake hit, Ms Majhi had shouted at her daughter for bothering her and had sent her off to play with neighbours. Now she says she will not rest until she can give her a proper funeral. \"We've found all the adults who died here and we've given them the last rites. I hope I can do the same for my daughter, otherwise I'll never forgive myself,\" she says. But Ms Majhi is not sure whether she will find her child. The owner of the excavator did not charge her to hire it, but he did make her pay for the fuel. It is running out now and she cannot afford to buy another tank. A few hundred metres away, across terraces of corn, men who have shaved their heads in mourning carry two bodies, shrouded in white, down to the river for cremation. These were found earlier in the day after another group of villagers hired the excavator for a few hours. It is the only help this area has seen since the quake ripped their lives apart. Then, out of nowhere, a bus arrives carrying dozens of Nepali volunteers. They are followers of the self-styled guru Master Godangel who stands at the roadside in robes of white and garlands of flowers and promises to help with food and shelter. \"I feel really upset about this government, I feel really, really upset,\" he says. \"It's a corrupt government.

As the rain starts to fall, the only place that Ms Majhi can take shelter is with her animals. \"We still have hope,\" she says. \"Helicopters are flying overhead.

Chairwoman of the assembly's Gypsy and Traveller Committee Labour AM Julie Morgan said the discrimination was an \"absolute disgrace\". According to the last official count over 900 Gypsy and traveller families live in caravans across Wales, with 35% living on sites in Cardiff and Pembrokeshire alone. In what is thought to be the first survey of its kind in Europe, about 100 Gypsies and travellers were interviewed by community champions as part of the study, between April 2016 and March 2017. Travellers spoke of difficulties accessing GP services, claiming they faced discrimination from receptionists and barriers filling in registration forms as many are illiterate. A distrust of dentists also led to children saying they had needed to have between 10 and 20 rotten teeth removed. Report author Dr Adrian Marsh said while some GPs gave travellers prescriptions for during the summer period, when they travel to festivals and cultural events, others did not.

Some evidence of good practice especially in north Wales were also highlighted in the report.

The fighters, who have been involved in an on-off rebellion since December, accuse President Francois Bozize of failing to honour a peace deal. Former colonial power France has called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, and reportedly sent troops to secure the airport. French officials warned French nationals in the country should stay at home. Rebel spokesman Nelson Ndjadder said they had shot down a government military helicopter and were now heading for the presidential palace. However, there were no further reports of fighting as darkness fell. The rebels are also said to have cut off electrical power to parts of the city, having taken control of three power plants in the neighbouring town of Boali. A local UN official in southern Bangui said people were in a state of panic but could not confirm the rebels had entered the city. The rebels joined a power-sharing government in January after talks brokered by regional leaders to end a rebellion they launched last year. But the deal quickly collapsed, with the rebels saying their demands, including the release of political prisoners, had not been met. On Friday it was reported that they had taken a checkpoint in the town of Damara, about an hour's drive from Bangui, where regional Fomac peacekeepers are based.

On Saturday it emerged that Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, would not deliver the traditional Hajj sermon for the first time in 35 years because of health complications. It follows controversy sparked by his remarks that Iranians were \"not Muslims\". The comments came after Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denounced Saudi Arabia's management of the Hajj. Iran has boycotted this year's pilgrimage., instead endorsing an alternative event on Saturday at the holy city of Karbala in Iraq. Tensions between the two countries have risen after a crush in last year's pilgrimage killed at least 2,426 people, including 464 Iranians, according to an unofficial count. Saudi Arabia and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and are at loggerheads over a series of regional issues including the conflicts in Yemen and Syria.

The cataclysmic explosion occurred after a fire broke out on SS Mont Blanc, all of which was caught on camera by Mr Magnus. SS Mont Blanc was described as a huge 'floating bomb' because of her formidable cargo. There were more than 2,000 tonnes of picric acid, 200 tonnes of TNT, 56 tonnes of gun cotton and 223 tonnes of motor fuel on board. Records show the ship exploded and disintegrated in seconds. Altogether 3.8 sq km (1.5 sq miles) of Halifax was flattened and more than 1,900 people perished. Avid photographer Mr Magnus managed to capture plumes of smoke and a town littered with ash in his photographs. After the war Mr Magnus had three children. His daughter, Anne Foreman from Hayle, Cornwall, decided to share her father's photographs during the anniversary of the outbreak of World War One. She said: \"This has brought him to life again. It's amazing, it brings tears to my eyes. Ms Foreman, aged 89, said her father was on watch during the morning of the explosion when he took the pictures. \"The blast absolutely blew Halifax town into oblivion, the whole of the harbour and the town was devastated. \"The thing that struck me most was a cannon that was blown three miles in land. Ms Foreman said her father was \"a kind and lovely man with a great sense of humour\". \"There are so many things I've found out about him and his experiences from these photographs.

{"text": "So why would a country like Zambia lift the ban on the shooting and killing of its precious lion and leopard populations? The answer is very clear - it is the need for foreign currency in order to fund sustainable wildlife programmes, which can be costly, and also to benefit local communities. Trophy hunting is a multi-million dollar industry - a licence to shoot a lion can cost up to $25,000 (\u00c2\u00a315,000) in neighbouring countries. Zambia's economy was built on the back of copper mining but now commodities are on a cyclical downward spiral. Consequently the country's currency, the kwacha, has lost a substantial amount of its value. For this small country, tourism is another way of bringing in foreign currency. There is no doubt that the beautiful banks of the Zambezi river in Livingstone and the Victoria Falls are still a draw card for international tourists but take a closer look at the numbers and it soon becomes clear that trophy hunters bring the lion's share of the greenback. Zambia's country director of the World Wildlife Fund Nyambe Nyambe told me that when the ban was initially announced back in 2013 \"there were not enough monitoring systems in place\". The government lifted the ban following expert recommendations which suggested that hunting resumption would \"assist communities in affected areas with access to financial benefits\", he said. Mr Nyambe also explained that \"concerns about the big cats conservation led to the ban in the first place and there is due recognition of the same as the ban is being lifted\". The authorities saw the need for a robust and implementable plan for leopards as well, as they have different needs to lions. Hunting regulations were structured only for lions because hunters were mostly interested in the king of the jungle. Mr Nyambe added: \"We hope and trust that the hunting of big cats will be an integral part of sustainable harvesting of wildlife resources.\" But critics say there is no justification for shooting majestic animals such as the elusive African leopard just so that wealthy hunters, largely from the West, can pose for photos with dead animals. And there is one country on the continent that wants no part in the hunting of wildlife - Zambia's neighbour, Botswana. It has an established tradition of \"shoot with the camera not the gun\". Last week an American hunter paid $350,000 for a licence to shoot a black rhinoceros in Namibia. Corey Knowlton, from Texas, killed the rhino with a high-powered rifle after a three-day hunt through the bush with government officials on hand to ensure he killed the correct animal, which had reportedly been chosen as it was old and had become aggressive. Mr Knowlton, 36, won the right to shoot the rhino at an auction - attracting criticism, and even death threats, from conservationists. His supporters argued that the money raised would be used to protect other rhinos - there are just 5,000 left in the world, 2,000 of which are in Namibia. Zambia cannot be singled out for criticism because trophy hunting, albeit not always for endangered species or exotic animals, is allowed in many parts of the world including Europe and the US. But to be fair to the international hunter, local communities also hunt animals for their own purposes - whether to eat or to protect their livestock from predators. Animal rights groups hope that someday, in the not-too-distant future, there will come a time when the killing of wild animals will simply be outlawed.", "summary": "Africa is home to some of the world's most majestic animals.", "human_descriptions": ["Africa having majestic animals is supported by the text but there is no proof that they are some of the world's most majestic animals.", "The summary states \"Africa\" as the subject, but the text speaks on Zambia and its policies."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3328}

The figure contrasted with a stronger-than-expected start for the manufacturing sector published on Monday. Factory output rose from 52.1 in December to 52.9 in January. Any figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector. Markit economist Tim Moore said construction firms were struggling for momentum, with increased economic uncertainty holding back new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since summer 2013. \"Taken together with the slowdown in new order growth, the latest survey suggests that construction companies are braced for a relatively subdued first quarter,\" he said. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which compiles the survey along with Markit, said a shortage of bricks and blocks contributed to the slowdown. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said weakness in construction orders and a downturn in public sector infrastructure work, which accounts for about a quarter of total construction and is not covered by the PMI, suggested the sector would post only \"lacklustre growth\" this year. Optimism among construction companies waned to its lowest level since December 2014, the survey showed. \"Some firms highlighted concerns that underlying demand conditions had started to soften,\" Markit said. Analysts use the PMI surveys for early signals about the economy. However, the construction sector figures have been at odds with data used in official growth figures in recent months.

But those bringing the case argue that it is vital MPs and peers get a say. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the Brexit process, is to be triggered by the end of next March. Campaigners say the prime minister lacks the power to do this without the prior authorisation of Parliament. But, arguing the government's case, Mr Wright said Article 50 was available to \"to give effect to the will of the people\", as expressed in June's referendum, in which a majority of voters backed Brexit. The use of the royal prerogative - powers historically held by the Crown but these days passed on to ministers - was \"wholly within the expectation of Parliament\", he said. Parliament had also passed an act allowing the referendum to take place, he added. The attorney general said the \"notification - once given - will not be withdrawn.

{"text": "MLAs have spent most of Tuesday debating the welfare reform bill, which has reached the consideration stage in Stormont's legislative process. The day's proceedings adjourned at 22:00 GMT but will resume on Wednesday. Welfare reform had caused an impasse until a deal was reached at December's inter-party talks in Stormont House. Politicians agreed to set aside tens of millions of pounds for a fund designed to provide financial support for those adversely impacted by welfare changes. Mr Robinson said the financial cost of not implementing welfare reform would have been at such a level that \"we could not have sustained an executive\". He said that other parties could not have an \"a la carte\" approach to the Stormont House Agreement. \"If people genuinely want to move forward in Northern Ireland, then it is important this legislation goes through. It's important that the parties uphold the agreement that all of us reached,\" he said. At the start of the debate, the DUP was accused of \"killing off discussion\" of the bill. Ulster Unionist Roy Beggs said the DUP had done so by tabling a series of petitions of concern against amendments to the bill. \"They have displayed the undemocratic nature of their attitudes as MLAs and the undemocratic nature of their party, which of course has the word democracy in their name,\" he said. Mr Robinson rejected Mr Beggs' claim that his party's actions were \"shameful\". The measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly. If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. Apart from the amendments tabled by Social Development Minister Mervyn Storey of the DUP, only two others - put forward by the UUP - survived. However, Mr Robinson, the first minister, said assembly members were still capable of discussing the bill as well as the amendments. The SDLP's Alex Attwood accused the DUP of trying to run a \"coach and horses\" through the amendments. \"Never before in the life of the chamber has there been such a swingeing attempt through petitions of concern to shut down what might be good law for the people of this part of the world,\" he said. Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness said some SDLP assembly members were defying their party leader Alasdair McDonnell by tabling the amendments in the chamber. \"The SDLP dissidents are clearly now in charge of the party and are prepared to risk the collapse of the Stormont House Agreement - and thereby the power-sharing institutions themselves - for the sake of party political grandstanding,\" he said. Generally, Northern Ireland Assembly bills reach their consideration stage a few months after MLAs first debate their principles. The fact that two years and four months have passed since this bill was last on the floor of the chamber shows just how difficult the arguments over welfare reform have been. However, the essential deal was struck before Christmas, with the parties accepting the introduction of universal credit and personal independence payments, to replace benefits such as jobseeker's allowance, tax credits and disability living allowance. Stormont is providing support for those adversely impacted financially by the changes to the welfare system by setting aside nearly \u00a330m to assist claimants who lose out in 2015/16.

Israel's military said at the time that Col Shomer felt his life was in danger. But the video released by B'Tselem appears to show the teenager running away after attacking the vehicle. Soldiers then jump out and pursue him. B'Tselem also said medical evidence suggested that he was shot in the back. The Israeli military has not commented on the video, but the Times of Israel reported that Col Shomer had been interviewed under caution by military police investigating the shooting following its release. The incident took place on 3 July at the Qalandiya checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah, the scene of frequent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops. A vehicle carrying Col Shomer, commander of the army's Binyamin Brigade, was hit by stones thrown by a group of youths, shattering its windshield. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said at the time that the colonel got out of the vehicle and ordered the stone-throwers to stop, firing a warning shot into the air. When the attack continued, he opened fire at the main perpetrator, it added. The IDF stressed that Col Shomer believed he was in \"imminent mortal danger\" and several members of the government praised his actions. But witnesses cast doubt on the commander's account. Ahmed Taher, 17, who was throwing rocks beside Kasbeh, told the Washington Post after his funeral: \"We were running away.\" Fahdi Ziad, who works at a nearby petrol station, told the Guardian that three Israeli soldiers - two wearing a helmet, and one without one - chased after the teenagers and opened fire. Mr Ziad said Kasbeh was about 10-15m (33-49ft) from the soldiers when he was shot. \"After he fell on the ground the soldier without the helmet went and checked him and kicked him,\" he added. Palestinian doctors also said the teenager was shot in the back and the side of the head. On Monday, B'Tselem released video footage recorded by a security camera at the petrol station showing the moments before the shooting. It shows a person believed to be Kasbeh running at the Israeli army vehicle as it passes by and throwing a stone. He then runs away as the car then brakes suddenly and at least two soldiers get out, brandishing weapons. In a statement, B'Tselem said the footage showed Col Shomer's claim of self-defence was \"unreasonable\". \"There is no doubt that the shattering of the jeep's front window with a stone endangered the passengers when it happened. However, Kasbeh was shot in the back after the fact, when he was already running away and posing no 'mortal threat' to the soldiers.

They do not permit killing him by firing three shots at his upper body,\" it added.

Another man arrested in Limerick on Monday has been released without charge. Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday the news that one of the London attackers - Rachid Redouane - moved there from Dublin should not alter existing travel arrangements between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The two men were arrested by Garda detectives and questioned about the use of documentation and Irish social security numbers in Redouane's name, Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported. An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police) detectives are working to identify the activities, addresses and associates of Rachid Redouane during his time in Ireland. However, Garda\u00ed have stressed their investigation is focused on theft and fraud offences rather than terror. The investigation into Redouane's time in Ireland has intensified over the past 48 hours. Thirty-year-old Redouane, who claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan, was based in the the east London suburb of Barking. He was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar. Details of his identity and background began to emerge when an Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police. It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009. It is reported that he lived in Harrow in north-west London. The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear. However, it is believed he obtained a European Union residence permit which allowed him to travel to the UK whilst he lived in Ireland. He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012. It is understood that it was this marriage that allowed Redouane to obtain a 4 EU FAM card given to spouses of European Union citizens. The couple lived in Rathmines on Dublin's south-side. Reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef. He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015. Redouane is understood to have had a 17-month-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged.

More than 6,000 Britons and 2,500 Germans died in the 36-hour Battle of Jutland, involving about 250 ships. Princess Anne joined First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for a service at a war graves cemetery in Rosyth. HMS Kent has weighed anchor at South Queensferry before heading to Orkney for further commemorations. Jutland, fought in the North Sea off the coast of Denmark, was the only major naval battle of the 1914-18 war. It brought together the two most powerful naval forces of the time and it became the largest sea battle in naval warfare history in terms of the numbers of battleships engaged. The events on Saturday were designed to mark the \"contribution and sacrifices\" made by those who served during the battle. The commemorations began with a wreath-laying service and then an act of remembrance at Rosyth Parish Church in the town where the battlecruiser force was based in 1916. A minute's silence took place following the ringing of a bell made from the hull of HMS Tiger, a battlecruiser which suffered light damage during the Jutland campaign. Ms Sturgeon said: \"The sacrifices made by those who fought in this battle, the largest naval encounter of the First World War, and by other seafarers throughout the conflict must never be forgotten.\" A service of remembrance was held in South Queensferry Commonwealth War Graves Commission's cemetery, where 40 casualties from the battle are commemorated or buried. Descendents of those involved in the battle, local school pupils and children visiting from Wilhelmshaven in Germany were part of the event. Singer Barbara Dickson, whose uncle was killed in the Battle of the Somme, sang Scottish lament Flowers of the Forest as Princess Anne laid a wreath to remember lives lost. Elizabeth Dickson, whose father survived but her uncle, aged 16, was killed in the battle, said: \"It's very important to commemorate because, always, the tradition of commemoration and the rituals of commemoration are important because they're healing.\" Admiral Lord West, a commander during the Falklands War who went on to be head of the Royal Navy for four years, said: \"We forget sometimes, these sailors didn't die in an instant.

The man and his wife took home only one baby from Thailand after the surrogate had twins, leaving behind son Gammy. The case has made international headlines, causing uproar in Australia. State authorities told the BBC they were now conducting a \"full investigation\" to assess the father's \"suitability\" to have a young child in his custody. A spokesman for Western Australia's department for child protection and family support told the BBC: \"Last night we were made aware of certain information by the police regarding allegations of the father's criminal background.\" Asked if convicted sex offenders have been allowed to keep their children, the spokesman said they assess cases based on \"individual circumstances\". Besides Down's syndrome, the six-month-old baby has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection. Surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua has been looking after Gammy as well as two children of her own. She claims his parents abandoned Gammy and had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the child's condition four months after becoming pregnant. Ms Chanbua, 21, has said the father met the twins, but only took care of the girl and refused to carry or look at Gammy even though the babies were side by side. The parents have told local media in Australia that they did not know of his existence, and claimed that the allegations made by Ms Chanbua are lies. But one local newspaper quoted a family friend saying the parents did know about the boy being born, apparently contradicting their version of events. \"Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,\" the friend said.

You think I am responsible for the racists in the rest of Europe or in England or in France?\" he said. Platini said Uefa had done a lot to tackle racisim, backing such initiatives as 'Never Again', but said he was \"not responsible for society\". He added: \"Society is not so easy.

Of course I feel bad because I am not a racist.\" The 56-year-old former France international midfiedler also insisted the issue of racism is one that extends far beyond the two host nations of Euro 2012. Platini, who has been Uefa president since January 2007, said: \"If you want to have a programme on racism you can go everywhere now because there is an increase in the nationalists in many, many countries. \"It is not just a fact only in Poland and Ukraine. \"You can go in France, United States, in England and you will find the problem of racism. \"You have more nationalists in many, many countries in east of Europe - that is true.\" The Uefa president has previously criticised the host nations, describing Ukrainian hoteliers as \"bandits\" for the rising cost of accommodation and bemoaning the quality of pitches in Poland.

The UCI acknowledged that \"a cloud of suspicion would remain hanging over this dark period - but that while this might appear harsh for those who rode clean, they would understand there was little honour to be gained in reallocating places\". The body has also ordered Armstrong and others to pay back all prize money from this period, and has commissioned an independent investigation into the whole Armstrong affair. Pending the results of the report, defamation proceedings against Paul Kimmage, a former cyclist and Sunday Times journalist, have been suspended. The statement added: \"The committee agreed that part of the independent commission's remit would be to find ways to ensure that persons caught for doping were no longer able to take part in the sport, including as part of an entourage.\" Armstrong, 41, and his United States Postal Service team ran \"the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen\", a 1,000-page United States Anti-Doping Agency report concluded.

Floyd Landis, a former colleague of Armstrong's who now admits to using drugs, claims this was hush money to cover up a positive test for the banned substance EPO that was collected from Armstrong during his victory at the Tour of Switzerland in 2001.

The BND reportedly collected information on European firms at Washington's behest to check if they were breaking trade embargos. According to the reports, the BND did not target German or US officials in the surveillance, as they are protected by a BND-NSA agreement signed in 2002. However, it has emerged that the German government knew about NSA spying on European arms businesses as early as 2008. The government found \"shortcomings\" in the BND's operations, German TV reports. Minister under pressure - by the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin: . Yesterday the tabloid newspaper Bild printed a picture of Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere - his nose elongated to Pinocchio proportions. \"Herr de Maiziere!\" the accompanying headline screamed. \"You lie with impunity!\" There's outrage here that Germany - for so long seen as the victim of American espionage - may have helped US spies to target other Europeans. And pressure is building on the government to reveal how much it knew. As the former minister in charge of the chancellery, Thomas de Maiziere was directly responsible for Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, in 2008. And that is when, it's claimed, the BND first told the chancellery that its agents were now helping the NSA to spy on European aviation, aerospace and defence companies. Mr de Maiziere has denied all knowledge, and maintains that he hasn't deceived anyone. But he says that - because the information is all classified - he is unable to comment publicly. Yet there are questions about who else was aware. Another German newspaper devoted its front page to a \"wanted\" poster. Among the mugshots of politicians and civil servants was Chancellor Angela Merkel herself. Spy scandal turns tables on German government . Mr de Maiziere denies having had any knowledge of malpractice at German intelligence.

The huge scale of NSA surveillance in Europe - including joint spying operations with the UK's GCHQ - was revealed in 2013 by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. There was outrage in Germany because of the scope of NSA spying, which allegedly included snooping on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone conversations. The revelations strained German-US diplomatic ties. Last July Germany expelled a CIA official based at the US embassy, as reports surfaced of several Germans having spied for the NSA.

{"text": "Army ants are a predatory nomadic species: they raid other insect colonies and are always on the move, without a permanent nest. In this lifestyle, finding the shortest foraging path - with sufficient workforce left over - is crucial. The new research shows they adjust their bridges to find that balance. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists say their findings have implications for creating intelligent, self-assembling systems. Many species of ants show many complex, collective behaviours. Fire ants form rafts, bridges and tower structures, while weaver ants in Australia build chains that \"sew\" leaves together to make nests. The American and German researchers behind the new study focussed on the army ant, Eciton hamatum. They travelled to Panama to observe this species in its natural environment, hoping \"to understand the simple rules that allow them to communicate and build the complex bridge structures\", said co-first author Matthew Lutz. The team used a 3D-printed, angled platform that mimicked the ants' natural environment but also allowed the scientists to adjust the path for their experiments. \"The ants started to form a small bridge at the tip of the angle, which then moved away, making the bridge bigger and bigger so as to shorten the path,\" explained Mr Lutz, a PhD student at Princeton University in the US. \"What was even more interesting was that the bridge didn't move as far away as it possibly could. It tended to stop at some intermediate point.\" If the angle to be bridged was wider, that \"bridge migration\" ceased even sooner. In the wild, a foraging trail contains several such bridges, and they respond to the intensity of the traffic overhead: \"If you stop the traffic across the bridge, it breaks in 1-2 minutes,\" Mr Lutz said. He and his colleagues reasoned that the ants were facing a trade-off between a shorter, faster path and the number of ants that had to be immobilised in building the structure - which would otherwise boost the community' foraging power. From a foraging perspective, the shortest path is not necessarily the most efficient one. \"This is an elegant, quantitative study of the wonderful adaptive abilities of army ants,\" commented Prof Nigel Franks, who runs an ant research lab at the University of Bristol. \"The army ants are such effective raiders that they deplete their prey as they go. They are here today, gone tomorrow. \"Using their bodies to build dynamic bridges and to cover \"potholes\" in their route makes sense to them, as opposed to spending time and energy bulldozing obstacles out of their way.\" Mr Lutz, an architect by training, is interested in self-assembling structures. \"I started doing this PhD in biology to study more specifically the structures that are formed by these ants,\" he said. Contemporary architecture and robotics are turning to natural self-assembling systems like the army ants to learn how to design and produce such dynamic structures in the future. \"In 10-15 years, this sort of stuff will be more common,\" Mr Lutz predicted. Chris Reid, his co-author on the study, expressed similar hopes. \"Artificial systems made of independent robots operating via the same principles as the army ants could build large-scale structures,\" said Dr Reid, who was working at the New Jersey Institute of Technology when the study was conducted but is now at the University of Sydney in Australia. \"Such swarms could accomplish remarkable tasks, such as creating bridges to navigate complex terrain, plugs to repair structural breaches, or supports to stabilise a failing structure.\"", "summary": "Scientists have used a 3D-printed platform to study an ant's ability to build bridges.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 3658}

Meanwhile, Kenya has been ordered to explain its doping controls or join those countries under scrutiny. Wada said that if Kenya's answers are \"unsatisfactory\", it could also face sanctions. There are 15 Kenyans currently banned for doping by athletics' governing body the IAAF. The \"non-compliant\" countries have failed to respond fully to Wada's request for information and Argentina, Bolivia and Ukraine have been found to be using non-accredited laboratories, which is a breach of the code.

This will continue until the country reinstalls quality anti-doping programmes. Wada cannot prevent athletes from \"non-compliant\" countries competing - such a decision is taken by organisations such as the IAAF and International Olympic Committee. Russia's athletics federation is already provisionally banned from international competition for its alleged involvement in widespread doping.

A coroner is writing to the director of Her Majesty's Prison Service demanding a review of the way officers are treated during disciplinary proceedings. The inquest heard Ms Norridge had ambitions of becoming a prison governor but was hit by a health scare - a relative had died of bowel cancer and she tested positive for a gene which gave her an 80 per cent chance of also getting the disease. The inquest was told she went to the doctor and was given three weeks off work to come to terms with the shock. But Ms Norridge went out with friends to see a live TV screening at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff of a 2011 Rugby World Cup match where she was seen by the colleague. Friend Rebecca Rolls told the inquest: \"She was interviewed by her employers who charged her with misconduct and lost her job. \"This destroyed Janet. She was so proud of her job and her profession.\" Ms Norridge's mother Joanne said her daughter was \"right in her feeling that she was unfairly dismissed\" and that she suffered \"unbelievable cruelty\" by the prison authorities.

But scientists at the University of Adelaide and Flinders University have discovered it contains a hormone that could help treat diabetes. Known as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), it is also found in humans and other animals, where it promotes insulin release, lowering blood glucose levels. But it normally degrades very quickly. Not for the duck-billed bottom feeders though. Or for echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters - another iconic Australian species found to carry the unusual hormone. Both produce a long-lasting form of it, offering the tantalising prospect of creating something similar for human diabetes sufferers. Lead researcher Prof Frank Grutzer told the BBC's Greg Dunlop why the researchers had decided to look at the platypus and its insulin mechanisms: \"We knew from genome analysis that there was something weird about the platypus's metabolic control system because they basically lack a functional stomach.\" They are not the only animals to use insulin against enemies. The gila monster, a venomous lizard native to the US and Mexico, and the geographer cone, a dangerous sea snail which can kill entire schools of fish by releasing insulin into the sea, both also weaponise the chemical. \"That's obviously something that can be powerful in venom,\" Prof Grutzer said, though he stressed it was not what had led them to the discovery. \"It was really coincidental,\" he said. He emphasised that much more research was needed before the discovery could, if ever, lead to a human treatment: \"An important experiment is going to be putting this it into mice and see how it affects blood glucose levels. That's certainly very high on our priority list. \"But to get to a drug is a very long journey.

France hosted the first ever grand prix in 1906 but lost its slot in 2008. There have been several attempts since to revive the race but this one looks to be the first to succeed. A news conference has been organised for an announcement about the future of the French Grand Prix in Paris on Monday, to be hosted by Christian Estrosi, the president of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. The French sports newspaper L'Equipe reported that a five-year deal had been agreed with the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region in association with the city of Toulon, department of Var and the French motorsport association.

{"text": "But there certainly should be. These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. \"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. \"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. \"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. \"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. \"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: . An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. \"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said. \"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. \"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says. \"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.

The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said the rate of attacks was dangerously high and could soon result in a serious incident. It has called for new police powers to help prevent attacks from taking place. The rate of attacks, in relation to the number of flights taking off or landing at Glasgow Airport, was \"significantly high\". There were 98,127 flights to and from Glasgow last year compared to 474,963 at Heathrow Airport, where there were 151 laser attacks. Birmingham and Manchester also continued to experience high numbers of attacks. Incidents at Edinburgh Airport dropped from 55 to 44 from 2015 to 2016. Across the UK, 1,258 laser attacks were reported in 2016, down from 1,439 the year before, which equates to more than three incidents a day on average. Balpa flight safety specialist Steve Landells said: \"We are concerned that at more than three reports a day this figure is still dangerously high. \"We're also concerned that under-reporting of incidents could mean that we don't have a true idea of the scale of the problem.\" He welcomed the new Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill, which proposes to increase the powers of the courts to allow them to impose prison sentences for laser attacks.

At one stage, a judge had warned that he would ban them from going near the area if they blocked work getting underway. However, with contractors able to move in without obstruction, the case had been adjourned to Friday for a further update.

Groundwater will also be protected by measures, including the drill shaft being encased in steel and concrete, according to the firm.

The mothers joined the study - published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood - before 22 weeks of pregnancy. Their babies were measured and weighed at birth and this was repeated at the age of three. About one in four of the deliveries were C-section births and the remainder were vaginal deliveries. The team found a link between body mass, skin thickness and how a child was born. They also found that mothers who delivered by C-section tended to weigh more than those delivering traditionally - something which is known to influence obesity. But the researchers said another possible explanation was the difference in the composition of gut bacteria acquired at birth between the two delivery methods. They suggested expectant mothers who choose a C-section should be made aware of the obesity risk to their babies. In the UK just over 23% of births are Caesarean.

Lira strengthens after result . Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will now begin the process of forming a new government. Mr Erdogan called the second general election this year after his AKP lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June and attempts to form a coalition failed. The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold needed to claim seats in parliament, but it got 21 fewer MPs than in June's election. The nationalist MHP's share of the vote also declined, to 11.9%, and commentators suggested it had lost voters to the AKP. Reported results also showed: . Clashes were reported in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, in the south-east of Turkey, as the results were being counted. Reuters said police had fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones. Since elections in June, a ceasefire between the Turkish army and militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has collapsed. Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of renewing violence to curb support for the HDP - something the government denies. In a statement on Monday, Ignacio Sanchez Amor, head of the OSCE observer mission, said: \"Physical attacks on party members, as well as the significant security concerns, particularly in the south-east... imposed restrictions on the ability to campaign.\" He added that pressure on journalists - including a police raid on the Koza-Ipek media group in Istanbul last week - was a major concern. Meanwhile Andreas Gross, head of the PACE delegation, said: \"Unfortunately, the campaign for these elections was characterised by unfairness and, to a serious degree, fear.\" HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas said on Sunday that it had not been \"a fair or equal election\". The party suspended campaigning after a bombing in Ankara last month killed more than 100 people. The government said the attackers were linked to the Islamic State (IS) group. Violence has escalated in Turkey since a suicide bombing in July by suspected IS militants. The attack near the border with Syria killed more than 30 Kurds. Turkish newspaper front pages reflect the contrasting euphoria and gloom from government supporters and opponents at the election result. \"Ballot box revolution\" declares Sabah, echoed by Aksam's \"November revolution\". Pro-Islamist papers are equally jubilant, with Yeni Safak hailing a \"magnificent victory\", and Yeni Akit offering \"congratulations to the Muslim world\". The independent mass-circulation Hurriyet and Milliyet focus on the scale of the ruling AKP's win. Opposition papers accuse the authorities of scaring voters with the prospect of civil strife. Cumhuriyet sees the \"victory of fear\", while the Sozcu tabloid thinks \"terror has increased\". The left-wing daily Taraf accuses President Erdogan of using a \"chaos plan\" to whip up public insecurity, and the pro-Kurdish Ozgur Gundem predicts a \"new era of struggle\".

Now all store assistants will earn a minimum of \u00a38.20, rising to \u00a38.80 an hour incrementally within three years.

{"text": "President Donald Trump has questioned the neutrality of Mr Mueller, who was appointed to investigate Russian interference in the US election. He has also blamed Attorney General Jeff Sessions for Mr Mueller's probe. Mr Graham warned Mr Trump that firing Mr Mueller \"would be the beginning of the end\" of his presidency. \"Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong,\" Mr Graham told reporters on Thursday. The Trump administration has sought to discredit Mr Mueller over his friendship with former FBI chief James Comey, who had been heading the inquiry until he was sacked by Mr Trump in May. The president has also suggested Mr Mueller's team of lawyers could be biased as some had made campaign contributions to Democrats. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington . There's no telling if Lindsey Graham's legislation insulating the independent counsel Robert Mueller from Donald Trump's wrath will go anywhere. The South Carolina Republican has been known to occasionally wander from the Senate flock. Still, this could be the first glimmers of bipartisan congressional efforts to construct a restraining barrier around the Trump presidency. Already it appears likely a bill preventing Donald Trump from unilaterally loosening current Russia sanctions will wind up on the president's desk. Despite the administration's objections that this infringes on executive foreign policy prerogatives, hardly any members of Congress have voted against the legislation. Now, amid concerns that Mr Trump may fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a way of getting at Mr Mueller, another set of handcuffs could be applied. The White House appears to be girding for war against those investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign. Chances are this more aggressive posture, including a presidential feud with Mr Sessions - who served in the US Senate for 20 years - will only make matters worse, however. Like a person trapped in quicksand, the more the president struggles, the deeper he sinks. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling it a \"witch hunt\". The South Carolina Republican announced he was creating a measure aimed at protecting Mr Mueller by mandating that any special counsel appointed to investigate a president or his staff could not be fired \"unless you have judicial review of the firing\". He added that Mr Trump was crossing a \"red line\" in his consideration to axe Mr Mueller, who was appointed by the Justice Department to lead the probe after Mr Comey was fired. Mr Graham's warning comes as the president has repeatedly attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia inquiry after failing to disclose a meeting with the Kremlin's envoy during his confirmation hearing. Mr Sessions, known for his hardline anti-immigration stance, was one of then-candidate Mr Trump's earliest supporters in Washington. Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he was \"disappointed\" with Mr Sessions, tweeting that he had \"taken a VERY weak position\" on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In an interview with the New York Times, the president expressed regret about appointing Mr Sessions, adding he \"should have never recused himself\". Anthony Scaramucci, the president's new communications director, fuelled the fire on Tuesday by suggesting the attorney general's days could be numbered. Mr Graham on Wednesday said \"there will be holy hell to pay\" if Mr Sessions is fired, warning that there would be \"no confirmation for a new attorney general in 2017\". \"This is not just a diversion, this is unnerving,\" he told reporters. \"It's unfair to Jeff Sessions, he's a good man who deserves better, and some of the suggestions the president is making go way beyond what's acceptable.\"", "summary": "US Senator Lindsey Graham is introducing legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1731}

Major General James Cowan, the regiment's senior officer, said: \"Our soldiers will be proud to parade in Edinburgh on Friday symbolising the support we receive from the wider community across Scotland and we are very grateful for Edinburgh City Council for allowing us to 'Exercise our Freedom'.\" \"Since the Regiment was formed in 2006 our soldiers have deployed almost continuously on operations around the world, so the Regiment is now building its own proud history as we head into the future. \"The service in the Canongate Kirk will provide us with an opportunity to reflect on our first ten years and commemorate those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\" Steve Cardownie, Edinburgh's Depute Lord Provost, said: \"It is a true honour to welcome The Royal Regiment of Scotland to the City Chambers. \"This parade is a fitting demonstration of Edinburgh's steadfast support for the brave men and women who continue to put their lives at risk in service of this country. \"Of course, as we celebrate the last decade, we will also remember those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.\"", "summary": "Soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland have taken part in a parade in Edinburgh to mark its 10th anniversary.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2755}

Hameed was eventually bowled by seamer Jamie Porter as the visitors reached 319, thanks largely to a counter-attacking 74 from debutant Dale Vilas. Essex were 35-2 in reply at the close. After Lancashire opted to bat first, Hameed, playing after being hurt on the same finger practising against the Cambridge students this week, shared a third-wicket stand of 68 with Liam Livingstone. Steven Croft (48) then gave the visitors' innings impetus, but a flurry of wickets in the afternoon session put Essex in charge as Lancashire were reduced to 160-6. On his Essex debut, former Lancashire paceman Neil Wagner (3-100) and Aaron Beard (3-47) did the damage, along with the run-out of Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 15 by substitute fielder Callum Taylor. South African Kolpak signing Vilas struck 10 boundaries as his 101-ball innings to ensure there was no collapse from the visitors, but their total was still looking a little below par when he was the penultimate batsman out with the total on 268. However, England's James Anderson (13 not out) joined Kyle Jarvis (28) to put on 51 runs in fewer than 10 overs, which frustrated the hosts, taking Lancashire past 300, giving them a third batting point.

Essex's former Lancashire paceman Neil Wagner told BBC Radio Essex: . \"It was tough graft out there. It was a pretty unresponsive wicket. It was quite good batting conditions with no cloud or moisture in the air and not much swing.

{"text": "It follows the revelation that the Church of England has dropped its opposition to gay clergy becoming bishops if they agree to stay celibate. The Reverend Martin Reynolds says his friend Jeffrey John, the Dean of St Albans, has been made a \"whipping boy\" in the row. He told Radio Wales it would be great if he could now become a Welsh bishop. Dr John, from Tonyrefail in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been at the centre of the row over gay bishops having twice been put forward for the role in the Church of England. In 2003 he declined the position of Bishop of Reading in the face of protests from traditionalists. He was also rejected as a candidate for the Bishop of Southwark in 2010, with evidence emerging it was because of his sexual orientation. On Friday, however, it was revealed that after a decision taken last month the Church of England would allow gay men in civil partnerships to become bishops as long as they promise to be celibate. Unlike the Church of England, the Church in Wales has never had a ban on gay clergy in civil partnerships becoming bishops. Mr Reynolds, an Anglican priest in Newport, claimed the reason the moratorium in the Church of England was introduced 18 months ago was because Dr John was about to become Bishop of Southwark. He told BBC Radio Wales: \"Rowan [Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury] didn't want another furore ... they shafted Jeffrey yet again - introduced this rule that you couldn't be in a civil partnership which of course Jeffrey is with Grant [Holmes, a hospital chaplain]. \"Poor old Jeffrey's been more than just a whipping boy - he's been assassinated really several times.\" Asked if there was now any realistic chance of his friend becoming a bishop in the Church in England, Mr Reynolds said: \"Wouldn't it be nice if he became a bishop in the Church in Wales?\" He added that gay clergy in civil partnerships in Wales are not asked \"if we do anything naughty in bed\". Asked about the question of policing the celibacy of gay clerics, Mr Reynolds said he believed honour still exists in the church. \"When Jeffrey said he and Grant weren't actually sleeping together anymore I think we all believed him. \"I don't think there was a single person ... that I ever spoke to said Jeffrey wasn't telling the truth.\" Mr Reynolds also praised the Church in Wales approach on the celibacy issue. \"In Wales we've never bothered, we've never tried,\" he said. \"Our bishop has never introduced any such a role and, of course, we know that the archbishop of Wales has said if there was a gay man who was in a relationship who was nominated, he'd be happy to ordain him.\"", "summary": "A gay clergyman has been \"assassinated\" in the row over gay bishops, his friend has claimed.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2885}

She collects them at the start of the school day and only hands them out for certain lessons. Her pupils have also honed their English skills by holding debates on whether they should be allowed in school and writing up their opinions.

The money will go towards operating costs at Randolph College in Virginia, which owns the Maier Museum. AAMD, which represents 236 directors of leading US art museums, called upon the college \"to stop this practice\". The Association was it was \"deeply disturbed to learn of Randolph College's continuing sale of works of art from the collection of its Maier Museum of Art to provide general operating funds for the College\". \"The prohibition against the sale of works of art from museum collections for such purposes is a violation of one of the most fundamental professional principles of the art museum field,\" a statement said. 'Other solutions' The AAMD said it initially contacted Randolph College in 2007 when its intention to sell off works from the college-owned Maier Museum was first made public. The Association said it offered help by investigating other means by which the college could tackle its financial shortfall. But in 2008 the college sold a Rufino Tamayo painting, Trovador, prompting the AAMD to censure the Maier Museum \"to signal its objection to this action\" and \"discourage\" further sales from the collection. Following last month's Bellows sale, it once again sought \"to encourage the College to find other solutions\" to support their operating costs. The college's unwillingness to alter their course led to the announcement of sanctions, which calls on all AAMD member museums to suspend loans to the Maier Museum and refuse collaboration on joint exhibitions. \"We appreciate both the College's decision to sell Men of the Docks to a public institution, thus ensuring that this work will remain in the public domain, and the educational exchange that the College and the purchaser of the painting, the National Gallery of Art in London, are launching,\" the statement continued. \"Nevertheless, these steps - however laudable they may be - do not mitigate the fact that the funds realised from this sale will be utilised for a purpose that we believe will, ultimately, be damaging to our field,\" it added. The Bellows purchase marked the National Gallery's first major acquisition of a painting by an American artist. \"We feel proud that an international audience will now become more aware of Randolph and our long stewardship of Men of the Docks,\" college president Bradley W Bateman said at the time of the sale.

The people of Scotland go to the polls on 18 September when they will be asked the \"Yes/No\" question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" Mr Salmond said the Swede's remarks, made in the Financial Times newspaper, were not only insulting to Scotland but to the Balkan countries that had joined the EU. Both Croatia and Slovenia have become EU member states since the bloody wars that tore Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s. Mr Bildt is a former prime minister of Sweden who also served as the UN's special envoy to the Balkans between 1999 and 2001. The FT quoted him saying that Scottish independence would have \"more profound implications than people think\". He added in the piece: \"The Balkanisation of the British Isles is something we are not looking forward to. It opens up a lot, primarily in Scotland but also in the UK. \"What are the implications for the Irish question?\" he asked. \"What happens in Ulster?\" In a BBC interview, the Mr Salmond took exception to these remarks.

It means people don't appreciate being told what to do, I think.\" Mr Salmond said the president's comments had come as \"a surprise\" because the US had declared itself \"neutral\" in the referendum campaign.

We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives. We wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of his dream. Next month Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the secretary of state for education and we were all very proud of him. We would like to thank the Ministry of Defence family liaison officer for all his help and support in these trying times. Speaking to Channel 4 news, Mr Capstick described how he was walking in the Beacons when he was passed by a line of soldiers moving in the opposite direction at five or 10-minute intervals. \"We then came across two soldiers who had clearly broken that intended mode of operation and were proceeding slowly together, and one of the soldiers made a compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague,\" he said. \"He was upset,\" he added. \"The other soldier was trying to make the best of the situation and asked if we could spare any water for his colleague, not for himself.\" Mr Capstick added that it \"certainly was slightly odd\" that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were \"clearly in distress.\" In a statement issued through the Ministry of Defence, Mr Roberts's father Kelvin said: \"We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives.\" He said he had died \"in the pursuit of his dream\". Mr Roberts, who had worked as a teaching assistant in London, was due to take up a job in Whitehall in the office of Education Secretary Michael Gove. He had served with the Territorial Army (TA) for more than five years and was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment. It is believed he served as a reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan, and had taken part in several exercises including a training mission in Texas with the American National Guard. He had taken part in a four-week trial for the TA SAS reservists ending in a 40-mile (64km) hike over the Brecon Beacons. L/Cpl Roberts was described as being \"the salt of the earth\" by one friend, who added that the soldier was \"extremely dedicated\". The University of Leicester economics graduate was described by Professor Ali al-Nowaihi as a \"very promising young man - independent, strong willed and determined\". BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said he understood the deaths occurred after the SAS training and preparation phase, right at the start of the selection phase. He also understood there were extra water supplies available in the area, in addition to the water the men were carrying. SAS selection course . The Brecon Beacons is home to the Infantry Battle School and makes up one of Britain's largest military training areas. According to the MoD website, the SAS (Reserve) selection course is run twice a year and consists of two main components - \"aptitude\" and \"continuation\". The \"progressively arduous\" aptitude phase is designed to select volunteers with the right qualities, including physical and mental robustness; self-confidence; self-discipline; the ability to work alone; and the ability to assimilate information and new skills. The continuation training - after passing aptitude - is an intensive period of instruction and assessment on Special Forces tactics, techniques and procedures, including weapons and standard operating procedures.", "summary": "A hiker who found the body of a soldier in the Brecon Beacons has spoken of the moment he found him.", "human_descriptions": ["The text does not indicate that David Capstick found anything; it describes him encountering two distressed soldiers who were alive."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3613}

Guatemala's National Disaster Reduction Commission (Conred) says it had warned as early as 2009 that the neighbourhood of El Cambray 2, which lies 16km (10 miles) east of Guatemala City, was at risk. The middle-class neighbourhood was built at the bottom of a steep hillside next to a river. Conred said its most recent warning came in November 2014, when it alerted local authorities to the fact that the river was eroding the base of the hill, making the hillside very unstable. However, residents said they had not been made aware of the risks. A spokesman for the local authorities in El Cambray 2 said what had happened was \"a natural disaster, like an earthquake or a volcanic eruption, which can't be foreseen\".

The move follows an investigation by the BBC and its US partners into Dapp Malawi, the Malawian branch of charity Development Aid from People to People. Dapp is one of the major NGOs active in Malawi, providing a range of aid projects from farming to health and education. The BBC found that part of the funding it received found its way to the Teachers Group, with some Dapp staff handing over as much as 30% of their monthly salary to the group. Founded in the 1970s, for years the Teachers Group has run a government-funded alternative school system, but in 2001 the Danish authorities raided its offices and charged its founder Mogens Amdi Petersen with fraud. Found not guilty in 2006, he and some of his associates immediately left the country, but prosecutors appealed and the group are now wanted by Interpol.

Monbeg Dude finished third and Alvarado came in fourth. Aspell, 38, becomes the first jockey since Brian Fletcher on Red Rum in 1973 and 1974 to win back-to-back Nationals, while it was a third success for 79-year-old owner Trevor Hemmings, who has previously won with Hedgehunter and Ballabriggs. Aspell said: \"It was wonderful and we will certainly celebrate tonight. I asked some big questions, but he dug deep. \"We really refreshed and recharged his battery and I tried to conserve energy. He is all heart. All season, he has had hard races. Win lose or draw, that's the best ride I have had in the National. I just hoped his battery life lasted out and it did.\" McCoy appeared well placed in the latter stages, but Shutthefrontdoor tired badly from the elbow. \"I thought from the third-last fence I was running on empty,\" McCoy said. \"I will miss riding horses and races like that.

Bosnian Serb officials warned the move would trigger a \"serious crisis\" in the country. In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for genocide. The ICJ found only one act of genocide during Bosnia's 1992-95 war - the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces in the town of Srebrenica in 1995. It was Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two. The ICJ ruled that Serbia had violated international law by failing to prevent the killings, but absolved it of direct responsibility. On Thursday, Mr Izetbegovic told reporters that \"the request [for a review] is being submitted at this very moment\". \"I think that I am on the path of truth and justice,\" he added. The appeal was launched before a 10-year deadline expires on 26 February.

The 26-year-old French national was born in Brussels and lived there before the Paris attacks. He would be held in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison in the Paris area, said Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas. The co-ordinated attacks carried out by so-called Islamic State in Paris on 13 November claimed 130 lives and left dozens more severely wounded. Belgium's federal prosecutor said Salah Abdeslam had been \"surrendered to the French authorities this morning (in execution of the European Arrest Warrant issued by France on 19 March 2016)\". He was then formally placed under arrest. Although he was initially held at a prison in Bruges, he had most recently been in custody at a high-security jail at Beveren, near Antwerp. Salah Abdeslam is charged in France with participation in terrorist murder and the activities of a terrorist organisation. He was also indicted by Belgian authorities last week over a shoot-out in the Forest area of Brussels in which four police were wounded, three days before he was arrested. Earlier, French criminal lawyer Frank Berton told French media that he would be taking on Salah Abdeslam's defence in France following a two-and-a-half-hour meeting between the two last Friday at Beveren. Mr Berton BFMTV (in French) he hoped the man would be judged \"for what he has done and not what he has not done... not for what he represents because he is the last survivor\". Most of the Paris attackers are now dead. Frank Berton has defended some high-profile clients in recent years: . Florence Cassez, a Frenchwoman jailed in Mexico in 2007 for 60 years for kidnapping but controversially freed in 2013. She is alleged to have been part of the Zodiacs gang . Dominique Cottrez, sentenced to nine years in prison in 2015 for killing eight of her newborn babies . Daniel Legrand, found guilty of child sex offences in 2004 as part of the Outreau case; his conviction was later overturned in one of France's most notorious miscarriages of justice . Mohamed Drici, jailed for involvement in Islamist attacks in 1995, in which 10 people were murdered . Mr Berton described Salah Abdeslam as \"falling apart because of the drama that unfolded in France\" and said he wanted to explain his actions. He said he was aware of the risks in representing his client, but insisted \"he has the right to a fair trial\". Mr Abdeslam's Belgian lawyer, Sven Mary, has spoken of the dangers he faced in representing him - telling France's Liberation website (in French) that he was threatened, assaulted physically and verbally in his office, and that on occasion police had escorted his daughters to school.

But Antonio levelled again, heading in Chris Burke's cross to leave new Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic with four points from his first two games. Media playback is not supported on this device . Watford are now on an unbeaten run of seven games, which has been overseen by three different head coaches, with Oscar Garcia leaving at the end of September and his replacement Billy McKinlay making way for Jokanovic two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Stuart Pearce's Forest have fallen away from the top two to sixth, with their last league victory coming at home to Fulham on 17 September, and they started slowly as Fernando Forestieri and Vydra both forced saves from Karl Darlow. A David Vaughan free-kick that was deflected narrowly wide was Forest's only response before Ighalo had the Hornets in front - and his third goal in his last three games - by poking in Gianni Munari's superb back-flick from Almen Abdi's cross. Media playback is not supported on this device . The lead lasted just two minutes though, as Abdi gave the ball away to Antonio who strode forward and finished from a tight angle, before Michael Mancienne seemed to be fortunate to get just a booking for bringing down Vydra when he was through on goal. Shortly after the break Vydra was brought down by Wilson and the Czech calmly rolled in from 12 yards to restore the lead. And the Hornets looked relatively comfortable afterwards, moving the ball around with confidence, until Burke did well to find space down the right and swung in a hanging cross that Antonio powered in at the back post for his eighth of the season. Vydra's shot straight at Darlow was as close as Watford came to a late winner, and they drop down to second after Derby's win at Blackpool. Watford head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: . \"I think we played very well in the first 60 minutes. The last 30 minutes we lost a bit of tactical order and tried to win the game with hearts and not minds. \"For me [the Mancienne foul] was 100% a sending off. It's the same with the penalty. For me both situations are sendings off.\" Forest assistant manager Steve Wigley: . \"It was a good point. We knew we were coming to a team that was in the best form they've been in this season. \"We knew we would have to play well and resolute is a good word to describe us. We showed a lot of character.

{"text": "In 1903, scientists decided Brontosaurus was a more complete specimen of a different dinosaur. But many more specimens of plant-eating sauropod dinosaurs are now known, revealing Brontosaurus to be different enough to warrant its own name. The results have been published in the open access journal PeerJ. The name Brontosaurus goes back to the so-called Bone Wars of the late 1800s, when rival fossil hunters Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope raced new dinosaur names into the scientific literature. In their quest for new specimens, Marsh and Cope were drawn to the rich fossil beds of the American west. Marsh's team found two long-necked sauropods. He named one Apatosaurus ajax (Apatosaurus means \"deceptive lizard\") and the second skeleton Brontosaurus excelsus (Brontosaurus means \"noble thunder lizard\"). Shortly after Marsh's death, a team from the Field Museum of Chicago found another dinosaur skeleton similar to both Apatosaurus ajax and Brontosaurus excelsus, but with features deemed intermediate between the two. This led the scientists to conclude that Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were just different species within the same scientific genus. Apatosaurus took precedence because it had been named first so, Brontosaurus excelsus became Apatosaurus excelsus. But the name Brontosaurus is still known by several generations of schoolchildren. It's not entirely clear why the name stuck, but it may be to do with its origins in the Bone Wars, when there was intense public interest in the discovery of new dinosaurs. It may also be because of the evocative meaning: \"thunder lizard\". Now, Emanuel Tschopp from the New University of Lisbon in Portugal and colleagues applied statistical techniques to calculate the differences between species and genera of diplodocid dinosaurs (the large-scale grouping that includes Apatosaurus as well as other long-necked plant eaters). It is only with new finds of dinosaurs similar to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus in recent years that it became possible to undertake a detailed investigation of how different they were. \"Until very recently, the claim that Brontosaurus was the same as Apatosaurus was completely reasonable, based on the knowledge we had,\" said Mr Tschopp. To their suprise, Brontosaurus emerged from the analysis as a distinct dinosaur. \"The differences we found between Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related genera, and much more than what you normally find between species,\" explained Roger Benson, a co-author from the University of Oxford. Thus, the researchers argue that it is now possible to resurrect Brontosaurus as a genus, different from Apatosaurus. Prof Paul Barrett, of London's Natural History Museum, who was not involved in the research, told BBC News: \"This paper is the most comprehensive study produced to date on the evolution of Diplodocus and its closest relatives and sets out some really interesting new ideas on how these animals are related, and how they should be classified. \"The author finds a number of ways in which the original specimens of Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus can be separated from each other and uses these to resurrect Brontosaurus as a separate entity. \"The conclusions seem entirely reasonable to me, as they are well argued and well supported, and it will be interesting to see how how quickly these suggestions are adopted by the community.\" Marsh's case was not helped by making an incorrect reconstruction of Brontosaurus' skull because of the limited material available at the time. He had assumed it was boxy, like another long-necked dinosaur from the western US known as Camarasaurus. But research in the 1970s showed that Apatosaurus - and thus \"Brontosaurus\" - would have had a slender, horse-like skull. This gave rise to a popular myth that \"Brontosaurus\" was simply an Apatosaurus with the wrong head.

{"text": "US biologists used homing pigeons to test the potential impacts of oil spills on birds' flight. \"Lightly oiled\" pigeons, they found, veered off course and took longer to return and longer to recover than birds with no oil on their feathers. The results are published in the journal Environmental Pollution. It is the first time that the effects of low level exposure to crude oil on long-distance bird flight patterns have been tested and suggests that even small amounts of oil could have serious impacts on migrating birds that are caught up in a spill. The researchers were surprised by their findings, as lead author Dr Cristina Perez explained: \"The general notion would be that these birds are 'fine', but in fact we found that even lightly oiled birds are not uninjured.\" Dr Perez continued: \"We expected that the birds would have difficulties with flight and be slower in their arrival, but we did not expect such an obvious flight path difference.\" The study used crude oil collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill which was applied onto the wing and tail feathers of some of the homing pigeons with paintbrushes. This pattern of oiling reflected that seen in wild birds from the spill. The pigeons were trained to repeatedly undertake flights of 161km between release points and their home loft, all the while carrying GPS data loggers. After release, most of the oiled birds took different flight courses which were longer in duration and distance than those of un-oiled birds. These longer flights, more than double the length of the un-oiled birds, avoided crossing lakes and made use of the updrafts from mountains. They chose to minimise the risk of overwater crossings and may have been using their knowledge of the environment to make the journey easier. Such options would be unavailable for migrant water birds that had become oiled on their first migration. Young birds, with their pre-programmed flight plans would have no idea of the environmental barriers, such as long overwater flights, that they would meet on their onward migration. Historically, the focus has been on understanding the impact on heavily oiled seabirds, but study co-author and project leader Prof Chris Pritsos stressed the importance of such work to understand the impact on lightly-oiled birds, which he pointed out \"were observed oiled but still alive and functioning\" after the Deep Water Horizon spill. Prof Pritsos stressed that these sub-lethal effects could seriously impact subsequent breeding attempts by migrant birds caught up in the spill. The team found that oiled pigeons failed to regain the body mass lost between flights, unlike the un-oiled birds. This is a bad sign for migrant birds as it suggests that they may not be able to refuel sufficiently on their migratory stopovers in order to continue their journeys. Oiled pigeons also delayed their journeys for longer than the un-oiled group; they even experienced physical difficulties in getting airborne. Dr Perez indicated that a combination of GPS data loggers and free-flying homing pigeons could be \"considered for testing the effects of other environmental contaminants\" for the sort of detrimental impacts that \"wouldn't be discovered in birds in a wind tunnel environment alone\". Dr Kees Camphuysen, an expert on the impact of pollution on seabirds at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research, who was not involved on the study, remarked that it was \"interesting that slightly oiled birds with only one task (fly home) were hindered and that the effect lasted fairly long\". Dr Camphuysen went on to stress that water birds are likely to be more badly affected by oiling than land birds like pigeons, as they will be unable to adequately clean their feathers when wet and matted at sea. The Deepwater Horizon spillage of 134 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico started on 20 April 2010. It was the biggest environmental disaster in US history and is estimated to have killed over one million birds.

Berry attended the Walden School in New York with fellow band member Mike Diamond, known as Mike D. The pair were later joined by Adam Yauch and Kate Schellenbach and released their debut EP in 1982. When Berry left the group, he was replaced by Adam Horovitz, known as Ad-Rock, and the band took a new direction as a rap group. Schellenback also left the group before the release of their 1986 album Licence To Ill, which debuted at number one in the US. The group became a huge commercial success, recording a total of eight studio albums over 25 years, which collectively sold more than 50 million copies worldwide. Four of them reached number one in the US, while their 1998 album Hello Nasty topped the album chart in the UK. Their best-known hits include (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!), Intergalactic, and Ch-Check It Out. Seven of their albums achieved platinum sales status and the band toured with Madonna in 1985. Beastie Boys remained a three-piece until Adam Yauch's death from cancer in 2012. In the same year, Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billboard declared them the biggest selling rap group since the magazine began recording data in 1991. Horovitz read a speech written by Yauch at the ceremony, which mentioned Berry as a formative member of the band's early years. Frontal lobe dementia is a form of dementia that occurs when the frontal lobes of the brain begin to shrink. It is an uncommon form of dementia and is thought to affect about 16,000 people in the UK. Frontal lobe dementia is distinct from Alzheimer's disease and comes on earlier in life, usually between the ages of 45 and 65. Symptoms include problems with behaviour, language and thinking. The frontal lobes of the brain are involved in behaviour regulation. The disease can alter a person's character - they may become impulsive and lose their inhibitions or become less outgoing and socially isolated. Source: Alzheimer's Society and NHS Choices . Mike D later confirmed that he and Ad-Rock would not continue with Beastie Boys, out of respect for Yauch. After he left the band, Berry went on to play guitar in several other bands - including Even Worse, Big Fat Love, Highway Stars and Bourbon Deluxe.", "summary": "John 'Ad-Rock' Berry, a founding member of rap group Beastie Boys, has died at the age of 47.", "human_descriptions": ["Ad-Rock was not John's nickname, but  Adam Horovitz's nickname.", "The summary states that John Berry died at the age of 47, but the text does not say he died"], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3244}

{"text": "It is a relationship that these days may be closer to a case of gritting one's teeth rather than a smile, at least when it comes to trade. As it is for most countries in Asia, China is North Korea's biggest trading partner. Except that of course that there's one major difference: North Korea would completely collapse without China's economic help. That's why the US has been persuading Beijing to help the international community ensure that the new round of sanctions would hit North Korea where it hurts - cutting off access to Pyongyang's biggest customer is one way to send a powerful message. The latest sanctions - imposed because of North Korea's nuclear programme - aims to cut its coal exports to China by 60%. But there have been international sanctions and censure in place before, and despite those measures, China has continued to buy products from North Korea. Chinese companies buy North Korean coal and textiles, for example, while at the same time selling food, arms and energy to Pyongyang. Partly this is out of an allegiance to an old but volatile ally, but also partly out of a desire to ensure the balance of power in the region is tipped in Beijing's favour. Many analysts say China's refusal to play ball means that the sanctions strategy isn't working. But as Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China\" tells me, it's not that the sanctions on North Korea haven't been working - \"it's that China doesn't get punished when it doesn't implement the sanctions\". While it's true that in recent years China hasn't been particularly strict about enforcing sanctions on North Korea, there's some evidence to show that trade between the two neighbours is slowing. China's trade with North Korea has been falling this year, some 13% from a year earlier according to data in May from the Korea International Trade Association. Exports were down 15.6%, while Beijing's imports fell by 9.8%. But Mr Chang points out that this is as much about the slowing of China's economy as it is about sanctions. \"Demand for commodities has slowed, and China is buying less of everything,\" he said. \"And it's not that big a sacrifice for China - it doesn't really need this coal anyway.\" In an article for the Conversation website, Kelvin Gray of the University of Sussex said that even if coal exports fall \"one area where North Korea has kept its exports [to China] healthy is clothing\". Machines and raw materials are sold to North Korea from a Chinese company, the North Koreans provide the labour, (probably for a fraction of the price it would cost in China) and then the finished goods end up back in China. The profits that the North Korean regime makes from this sort of trade is difficult to calculate - but it is almost certainly in the hundreds of millions. It's a relationship that Beijing is unlikely to sever - and not for the usual argument that you hear about North Korean refugees flooding the Chinese border should the state collapse - at least, not according to Mr Chang. \"The first place North Koreans would go if the country were to collapse wouldn't be China, it would be South Korea,\" he said. \"The real reason why China keeps the North Korean state alive economically is because it whenever Pyongyang fires off another test, Washington comes running to Beijing for help.\" Mr Chang adds that this is a position China likes and wants to keep. And, he says, that unless Washington starts punishing Beijing for not enforcing these rules, this round of sanctions is unlikely to have much of an effect either.", "summary": "The relationship between China and North Korea is one of the closest in the world.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states that the relationship between China and North Korea is one of the closest in the world, but the text describes the relationship as strained, with China reluctantly supporting North Korea for strategic reasons rather than closeness."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2844}

They had been prostituted in a variety of locations, including truck stops, casinos, motels as well as on social media and online advertisements. Mr Hosko said the accused had preyed on vulnerable teenagers, exploiting them over a period of time. \"Girls are enticed with compliments or offers, [asked] do they want to make some money,\" he said. \"Then they are trapped into this cycle that involves drugs, that involves physical abuse.

The Monetary Policy Committee will \"have to feel its way as it goes,\" Mr Carney said in a speech at Lincoln Cathedral. He added: \"Short term interest rates have averaged around 4.5% since around the Bank's inception three centuries ago. \"It would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. \"In my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year,\" he added. His comments come a day after unemployment rose for the first time in two years. \"That suggests the Bank's interpretation of those statistics is that unemployment falls are now being held back by skills shortages,\" said the BBC's economics editor Robert Peston. \"And those skills shortages are also responsible for rising wage inflation.\" On Tuesday, outgoing MPC member David Miles, regarded as someone who is cautious about the impact of rise, surprised markets by saying it was \"likely to be right\" to hike rates soon.

{"text": "But none of the groups fighting on the ground have been invited. So absent from the talks will be both the Assad government and the Syrian political opposition, as well as the myriad other rebel militias fighting the Assad regime. Syria's Kurds won't be present, and of course jihadist militants of the so-called Islamic State (IS) won't be either. But the hope is that if outside powers can bridge their differences, it could be a first step towards influencing at least some of the warring sides. And some things have changed since the last abortive diplomatic push to end Syria's war: Iran's nuclear deal has made it a more acceptable partner to the United States and its allies. Russia has more incentive to push for peace: to keep its military involvement in Syria limited. The mounting refugee crisis has increased pressure on Syria's neighbours and on European countries too. And there is growing alarm at the way IS militants keep extending their reach. The focus (not for the first time) will be on how to agree a political process, including changes to Syria's constitution and new elections, to open the door to a broader transition. The main sticking point remains President Bashar al-Assad's role, and whether he should be allowed to stay or at some point be forced to stand down. So where do the most important countries attending the Vienna talks now stand? The United States and other Western powers (who held a pre-meeting in Paris to present a united front in Vienna) have shifted slightly recently. They no longer say Mr Assad must go as soon as possible, but rather that a transition must guarantee that he departs under a precise timetable. Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which had been insistent Mr Assad must go, may also be softening their position somewhat. The Saudi foreign minister on Wednesday still insisted he must step down, but within a specific time frame. But Russia and Iran, both backing President Assad militarily, claim he is a necessary partner in the fight against IS jihadists, and whether he stays or goes is not a matter for outside powers, but for the Syrian people to decide in elections. What is less clear is whether behind the scenes they are prepared to be more flexible, or less. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denounced elected leaders being ousted under pressure. He recently invited Mr Assad to Moscow to show him his support. But senior Russian officials have usually been careful to offer support to Syria's legitimate government, rather than Mr Assad himself. So would Russia support a compromise? Iran meanwhile has said there is no reason for Mr Assad to go, since he won re-election last year and his term should last until 2021. Will Tehran make him staying in power a red line? If there were no agreement in Vienna it would not be surprising, but it could also be dangerous.

On Friday, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) published revaluation details of 1.96 million non-domestic properties in England and Wales. But BT said: \"It is highly likely that an increase of this size would lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses.\" The telecoms giant warned that if the proposed new rates are brought in, \"it could have a negative impact on future investment in the network\". That point was echoed by Virgin Media chief executive Tom Mockridge, who said: \"The Chancellor Philip Hammond is choosing to side-step responsibility for a huge increase in infrastructure taxes, at the very moment after the Brexit vote the UK needs to maximise investment into its digital fibre network.\" BT said it will challenge the VOA's \"method and assumptions\". \"The Government has made it clear that it wants companies such as BT to invest heavily in the UK.

{"text": "Bemba, 53, was accused of failing to stop his rebels from killing and raping people in neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR) in 2002 and 2003. He had sent more than 1,000 fighters to help put down an attempted coup. Bemba, once vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, will remain in custody until sentencing. The court in The Hague found him guilty of several charges including rape and murder. He is expected to appeal. It is the first time the ICC has focused on rape as a weapon of war, and the first time a suspect has been convicted over crimes committed by others under his command. The fact that Bemba was convicted for sexual violence is significant. Many Congolese suspects have been accused of such crimes, but this is the first guilty verdict. His conviction was for crimes committed in the Central African Republic, but it will send the message to high-ranking soldiers and militiamen in DR Congo, where sexual violence is rife, that they are responsible for preventing it. But in Congo, despite his murky record, Jean-Pierre Bemba still enjoys significant popularity. Members of his opposition party had hoped he would be released in time to run in the next presidential election, which is scheduled for the end of this year. Welcoming the verdict, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said: \"While the reality of the crimes is appalling, the significance of this decision is to be celebrated. \"What this decision affirms is that commanders are responsible for the acts of the forces under their control.\" Carrie Comer, from the International Federation for Human Rights, said the verdict was \"a historic moment for victims of such unspeakable atrocities\". It was \"a strong message from ICC judges that commanders must prevent and punish war crimes,\" she wrote on Twitter. It is alleged that for a period of five months Bemba's Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) rebel fighters killed hundred of civilians, raped women and looted. The court heard horrific accounts, including how a man, his wife, his daughters and his granddaughter were all gang-raped by militiamen. Who is Jean-Pierre Bemba? Profile: Jean-Pierre Bemba . More about DR Congo . Bemba's lawyers argued that once the troops had crossed the border they were no longer under his command, but under the then-CAR President Ange-Felix Patasse. But the presiding judge ruled that Bemba had effective control over the troops and was therefore \"criminally responsible\". Mr Bemba led the MLC during DR Congo's brutal civil war. He is the son of a prominent businessman and a former assistant to ex-Congolese President Mobutu Sese Seko. After a peace deal in DR Congo in 2003, he laid down his arms and joined an interim government. Bemba is the most senior figure to face judgement at the court and only the third person to be convicted since the court's founding in 2002. Germain Katanga and Thomas Lubanga, both Congolese former warlords, have previously been found guilty of offences. What does this verdict mean for the ICC? This is a rare success for a beleaguered institution. It is the court's first conviction for rape as a war crime and establishes the principle that commanders are responsible for the actions of their subordinates. Why have there been so few convictions? The cases are often complex and so it takes a long time to go through the evidence. There are also logistical problems such as bringing witnesses from remote areas and organising translators. However, some cases have collapsed, most notably that of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta. Why are most of its cases in Africa? This is a question African leaders have often asked - they say the many African cases are evidence of discrimination. Critics say leaders such as Mr Kenyatta and Sudan's Omar al-Bashir have used accusations of bias as a smokescreen to evade justice. One former president, Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo, is on trial accused of war crimes. And the ICC is investigating non-African cases.

{"text": "Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. \"It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,\" Nish says. \"The code-overlaps are significant.\" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \"It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a \"kill switch\" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them.

{"text": "The data show subsidence of up to 23cm (9in) as a roughly 20km-long fault ruptured in the Apennine mountains in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Scientists will use the information to better understand what caused the magnitude-6.2 event and to make hazard assessments for the future. Almost 300 people are now known to have died in the big tremor. The worst affected town was Amatrice, but the settlements of Arquata, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto were also badly hit. The specialised picture displayed at the top of this page is what is known as an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) map. It is made by combining observations of the ground acquired by orbiting satellites \"before\" and \"after\" a quake. The coloured bands, or fringes, represent movement towards or away from the spacecraft. In this case, each fringe is a step of 2.8cm. \u201cThe InSAR data show that the earthquake has warped the Earth's surface by a maximum of 23cm, causing subsidence in a 25km-long elongate region roughly between the towns of Norcia and Amatrice,\u201d explained Dr Richard Walters from Durham University, UK, who built the map. \u201cThe fault that ruptured was around 20km long. The average slip at depth on the fault was about half a metre, but is concentrated in two major patches, which probably means two separate fault segments ruptured together. \u201cMost slip took place at depth, with only a small amount reaching the surface.\u201d . Dr Walters is affiliated to Britain\u2019s NERC Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET). To make the map, he used radar data from the European Union\u2019s Sentinel-1a and 1b satellites. These spacecraft circle the globe, routinely imaging all land surfaces at least once every six days. Their rapid return to any one location means they were in a position to view central Italy as soon as Friday after the quake, and then again on Saturday. Dr Walters\u2019 point about most of the slip being at depth illustrates the usefulness of InSAR. Not all ruptures will show an obvious surface expression, such as a buckled road or a newly opened fissure in the ground. But the InSAR data, in revealing the scale of warping, still permits scientists to trace the fault involved even if some of its sections are somewhat hidden. This was true of 2009\u2019s damaging quake in L\u2019Aquila, to the south of Amatrice, which killed 309 people.

The show is his first in the UK since 2009's Banksy v Bristol Museum show which drew huge crowds. Banksy described the show as a \"family theme park unsuitable for children\". He said he had been motivated to work on the site which had been \"popular with low income holiday makers\" after peering through a gap in the fence in January. Many of the works require \"audience participation\". \"A dead princess is only complete when surrounded by gawping crowds with their cameras out, or the opportunity to photograph yourself pulling an amazed expression when a killer whale leaps from a toilet,\" he said. \"I guess you'd say it's a theme park whose big theme is 'theme parks should have bigger themes'.\" Dismaland is the official name but it's really Banksyland. Subversive, darkly comic and cocking a snook at authority there are good reasons why the mysterious Mr Banksy is so popular. His stencils are well known but this is something very different - a pitch black antidote to the 'fun day out'. The Julie Burchill 'Punch and Judy', the riot torn village, the 'magic castle' with a paparazzi and Disney centrepiece and, of course, an exit through the gift shop. Fun for all the family? No. Something Britain's seaside has never seen before? Yes. Weston is bracing itself for crowds. Speculation had been growing that the elusive Bristolian was planning an exhibition after a castle and sculpture made from tanker trucks were spotted above the walls. Locals had been told a Hollywood company was filming there. Nigel Ashton, leader of North Somerset Council, said: \"We have been working closely with the organisers for months now and, for obvious reasons, have had to remain tight-lipped about the true nature of the event. \"In fact, only four people in the entire council knew what was really happening.\" The transformation inside the Tropicana is quite stunning. It's still the run-down lido it has been for the past 15 years, but now there's art everywhere. From the moment you walk through the fake airport-style security you get the dismal tone of Dismaland. Grumpy guards play the part astonishingly well. Inside you see Banksy's Cinderella castle and his Grim Reaper dodgem, which dances to the song Staying Alive. But you also get a heavy dose of other local and international artists. Damien Hirst makes contributions alongside others.

On Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously backed a resolution endorsing a road map for the peace process, including negotiations, a ceasefire and elections. But the resolution avoided contentious issues, including who could represent the opposition at the peace talks and the fate of Mr Assad. Mr Wang declined to answer directly when asked if Mr Assad should remain in power. \"China's position is very clear. We believe Syria's future, its national system, including its leadership, should be decided and set by the people of Syria.\" The United States, which supports the Syrian opposition, wants a negotiated settlement based on the 2012 Geneva Communique, which calls for the formation of a transitional governing body. It says President Bashar al-Assad must go. Russia, which launched an air campaign against Mr Assad's opponents in September, also calls for the implementation of the Geneva Communique. But it says Mr Assad's future is for the Syrian people, not external powers, to decide.

{"text": "But the co-founder and chief executive of UK chocolate shop chain Hotel Chocolat says he was actually inspired to set up his own business after seeing the success of his father's other company - a printing firm. Since the first Hotel Chocolat store opened in 2004 the company has gone on to grow into a multi-million pound empire, with 81 shops, eight cafes, two restaurants, and a hotel. As soon as Mr Thirlwell, 51, starts talking, there's no mistaking what drove the firm's evolution. He speaks about chocolate with such evangelical zeal he is bouncing up and down in his chair. Talking wistfully about the 18th Century, when chocolate houses were all the rage in London, Mr Thirlwell admits that his fantasy is to \"make cocoa the hero\" again - educating people to recognise and appreciate the higher cocoa content in the chocolate Hotel Chocolat produces compared to some of the best-known brands. \"We want consumers to be having the same debate about the flavours of different cocoa beans as wine,\" he says. Mr Thirlwell's desire to educate extends to leaving chocolates he thinks people should like on the shelves even when they're not selling. The firm's 100% dark chocolate products, for example, took five years to become profitable. Yet using large amounts of cocoa doesn't come cheap, and the firm's \"Signature Cabinet\", which has three drawers full of chocolates, costs a whopping \u00a3160. But Mr Thirlwell says the pricing makes sense if you look at the cost of the cocoa hit, as well as the packaging. He points out that by contrast, the firm's entry level \"Selector\" range starts from \u00a33.75. \"It's very important to us that we're accessible,\" he adds. Such a wide-ranging pricing structure seems to work with customers, as the company enjoyed sales of \u00a370m in the year to the end of June 2013. And it is continuing to expand apace. Hotel Chocolat's rapid development has been helped by the creation of innovative chocolate bonds, through which it has raised around \u00a35m from investors, to whom it pays \"interest\" in chocolate. Mr Thirlwell picked up the business bug working for his father's printing firm in his school holidays. He says it gave him a strong sense that running a company was \"exciting\". Nonetheless, he \"didn't have a clue\" what he wanted to do with life until he got a job at a French hi-tech firm as part of his French and economics degree. The lure of business was so strong, he dropped out of his course altogether, staying on in France to help the company export its products. It was on his return to the UK that Mr Thirlwell met Hotel Chocolat's co-founder Peter Harris, who interviewed him for a sales and marketing job at another tech firm. They hit it off so well that just 10 months later, they left together and in 1987 set up Hotel Chocolat's forerunner - The Mint Marketing Company (MMC), which sold packaged mints branded with company logos. Mr Thirlwell got the idea for the business after his father told him that the most successful promotion the printing company had been involved with was for such a product. To fund MMC Mr Thirlwell and Mr Harris both took out \u00a35,000 personal loans. Unfortunately, the wrapping machine they'd bought didn't work, and they had to hand wrap 20,000 packs to make their first order. Mr Thirlwell admits many people would have seen this as a sign that it wasn't meant to be, but he says that this is \"rubbish\". \"Lots of businesses have some early setbacks,\" he says. \"You've just got to overcome them somehow. \"These things happen all the time even when you're established. You just swat them away more easily.\" MMC evolved into Choc Express when their customers asked if they had anything beyond mints, and they started selling chocolates online in 1993, becoming one of the UK's earliest e-retailers. Then in 2004 they opened their first store in Watford, after changing the name of the business to Hotel Chocolat. But why would a retail business wish to call itself a hotel? Mr Thirlwell says: \"It was aspirational. I was trying to come up with something that expressed the power that chocolate has to lift you out of your current mood and take you to a better place.\" \"Everyone agreed 'chocolat' sounded better than chocolate. It's almost onomatopoeia, and suggests how the chocolate melts in your mouth.\" A decade later, the business does own a hotel, which it built in Saint Lucia beside its own cocoa plantation, which provides some of the cocoa for its chocolates. The company also now has two restaurants, one in London and one in Leeds, serving sweet and savoury dishes that include cocoa. Plus it has stores in Copenhagen. And from originally outsourcing production of its chocolates, Hotel Chocolat now makes them all itself at its own factory in Cambridgeshire. Despite Hotel Chocolat's expansion, not a single part of the range gets onto the shelves without first being approved by Mr Thirlwell. He chairs a tasting session every Wednesday, where they try new recipes and combinations, and calls this the \"triage\" of the brand quality. \"It's the beginning of the product, so if I let anything past there that I'm not happy with - it could affect the brand.\" Customers can also get in on the act via the firm's Tasting Club - a monthly box of new chocolates which members test and score. The club now has 100,000 members who have given the business a vast range of data on the public's tastes.

Some unionists have been reluctant to take part in or support the events. Michael D Higgins also said the commemorations are an example to the UK of how to reflect on its own history. The Easter Rising, a brief and militarily unsuccessful republican revolt, is seen by many historians as a significant stepping-stone in the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of the island. A greater depth of knowledge, President Higgins said, meant the Easter Rising was now being put \"in context of what was happening in Europe\" 100 years ago. \"I do think that without 1916, and the events that surrounded it, we would not have achieved our independence,\" he said in a wide-ranging interview for the BBC. \"It is one of the founding events, without a doubt, and it is of immense significance in terms of where it occurs historically but also symbolically.\" President Higgins said Ireland's approach to the rising's centenary was one of \"ethical sensitivity\". And he added that \"it is responsible not to be seeing fears where there are none\". \"My great hope, as head of state, is that we will put ourselves into each other's history,\" he said. \"We must be able to take your version, my version, move into the shoes of the other, and we must be open to changing our versions as new facts, information and analysis become available to us. \"I would hope that people in Northern Ireland will approach these commemorations, and as we commemorate the [Battle of the] Somme, that we'd be able to do so generously.\" President Higgins said people must not \"become a prisoner of the past\" and \"mustn't allow any distortions of history\". He said everyone's take on history must be open to critique, and that Britain, like Ireland, had to closely examine its past. \"When we decide to address the issue of violence, let us speak of the violence of empire, the violence of state, the violence of insurrection,\" he said. \"Let's do it all - this is the challenge that people are not rising to. \"Having spent decades revising nationalism, where is the evidence that there is as much energy put into addressing the issue of empire? \"As empires came to establishing their stamp on neighbouring countries, what was the consequences of that?\" He described the Northern Ireland peace process as \"fragile\" and an \"ongoing project\", but added it would be \"pessimistic and wrong\" to say significant reconciliation had not been achieved. \"There is real reconciliation going on,\" he said. \"You don't keep picking at the sources of division to undermine what progress you're making in the present in terms of reconciliation.\" Earlier this week, the Inniskillings Museum in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, presented President Higgins with a green harp flag that had been taken by a soldier from Dublin's Liberty Hall during the rising.", "summary": "The Republic of Ireland would not have achieved its independence without the Easter Rising, the country's president has said.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1821}

Shanghai-based Zhizhen Network Technology has sought to block Apple from selling products with the app installed, saying it infringed its rights. Apple said it would pursue an appeal with the Beijing Higher People's Court. \"Apple believes deeply in protecting innovation, and we take intellectual property rights very seriously,\" said a spokesman. \"Apple created Siri to provide customers with their own personal assistant by using their voice. \"Unfortunately, we were not aware of Zhizhen's patent before we introduced Siri, and we do not believe we are using this patent. \"While a separate court considers this question, we remain open to reasonable discussions with Zhizhen.\" The Chinese company could not be reached for comment. Zhizhen offers its own voice-controlled service, named Xiao i Robot, which began life, in 2003, as a text-based chatbot that ran on others' instant-messaging tools. It later evolved into call-centre software used by the Chinese government and several companies. In addition, Zhizhen developed voice-controlled software for smart TVs, cars and smartphones - including an iPhone app that allows users to find restaurants, train times and stock prices. In June 2012, Zhizhen accused Apple of intellectual property infringement after the US company announced at its developers' conference that Mandarin and Cantonese were being added to the list of Siri's supported languages. Zhizhen noted that it had filed for the intellectual rights to the underlying technology in 2004 and had been granted the patent two years later. Apple countered that Siri used a different process to power its voice-recognition tech - a court has yet to rule on this claim. Apple also sought to block the case by asking China's State Intellectual Property Office to invalidate the patent, but was refused. It then challenged that decision, suing both the patent authority and Zhizhen - but was thwarted on Tuesday when Beijing's Number One Intermediate People's Court ruled against it. The China Mobile Internet Industry Alliance previously told the Xinhua news agency that it did not believe the case would result in Apple pulling its products from China, but added that the US company might have to seek a financial settlement.", "summary": "A Beijing court has ruled in favour of a Chinese company in a patent dispute with Apple.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 3649}

The UK economy has defied some of the gloomiest predictions since the EU referendum.

While imports are more expensive, of course the pound's fall also makes UK exports cheaper. But that also makes sourcing produce harder as well, says Brian. \"Produce in the UK is getting sent abroad because it's worth more for those fishing for the fish to send it abroad.\" His sister, Mariella, says: \"All our prices, for anything from outside this country, have gone up. Our average profits have fallen by up to 15%. We cannot pass that on.\" Traders say they try to absorb as much of this extra cost as they can but that might change soon.

Asad Shafiq (49) and Sarfraz Ahmed (45) batted Pakistan into a strong position. England bowled well - Chris Woakes taking another five-wicket haul - but dropped two catches late in the day. Stuart Broad spilled a difficult chance to dismiss Yasir Shah (30 not out) at mid-off and then wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow dropped what was more of a regulation catch to end a punchy innings from strokemaker Sarfraz. They may also rue the moment Younus Khan, who put on 69 with Shafiq for the fifth wicket, had a leg-before dismissal reversed following a review with the score at 75-4 and Pakistan's lead just 142. Media playback is not supported on this device . Woakes was head and shoulders above the rest of his team-mates with the ball. The Warwickshire all-rounder started the day hoping to push England closer to Pakistan's first innings total of 339 all out. However, he was let down by his batting partners as England's last three wickets fell for 19 runs - leaving Woakes unbeaten on a well-constructed 35. He then shone with the ball, recording what are currently the second-best match figures (11-101) by an England bowler this decade. His expert line and length, which is delivered at a livelier pace than when he made his debut in 2013, saw him snare opener Shan Masood via a catch at first slip and helped him to pin Azhar Ali in front. He returned later in the day to bowl the obdurate Asad Shafiq for 49 and have both Sarfraz and Wahab Riaz caught behind with an outswinger and attempted bouncer respectively.

More than 19 million people took part in the referendum on whether to keep first-past-the-post, where voters put a cross next to their preferred candidate, with AV, which sees candidates ranked in order of preference. These preferences could have been used to decide the outcome in constituencies where no candidate wins more than 50% of votes cast. The Conservatives backed keeping the existing system, while Mr Clegg's Liberal Democrats urged change and Labour was split on the issue. Overall turnout for Thursday's referendum was 42%, with 6,152,607 voters backing the proposal and 13,013,123 rejecting it .

{"text": "Kevin McKearney and his elderly uncle Jack McKearney were shot at their family shop in County Tyrone in 1992 by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Their family has welcomed the report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET). The HET found no evidence of security force collusion but also said it could not allay the family's suspicions. The report has identified eight areas of concern about the security force operation, both in the lead up to and the aftermath of the murders. The McKearney family were well-known in Republican circles and felt they were particularly vulnerable to attack. Days before the murders, Kevin's mother Maura had received a telephone call threatening that three men \"in white coats\" would be killed in Moy Square. The family, several of whom wore white coats while working at the butchers shop they owned in the centre of the County Tyrone village, reported the call to police through a local councillor. The HET report has concluded that the RUC \"did not formally record or investigate the reported death threat\". It stated that the McKearney family were given no police advice about their personal security after they were threatened. The inquiries team also said that the loss of forensic material during the RUC investigation, and the \"fact that a special branch officer was aware of the getaway car three minutes after the murders\" remained unexplained. Kevin McKearney, a father of four, was working behind the counter of the butcher shop on 3 January 1992 when a gunman walked in a shot him several times. The 32 year old died at the scene. His 68-year-old uncle John McKearney - known as Jack - was shot and seriously wounded in the attack. He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries three months later on 4 April 1992. The murders took place two weeks after a Protestant man was shot dead by Republican paramilitaries at his family's shop in the same village. Robin Farmer, the 19-year-old son of a policeman, was murdered on 21 December 1991 by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). The HET report stated Mr Farmer's murder had \"raised fears among the Catholic community in Moy of a retaliatory attack because of the history of tit-for-tat sectarian murders in mid-Ulster throughout the Troubles\". Mrs McKearney received the death threat from anonymous caller just six days after the teenager was killed. The butcher shop murders were not the first time the Troubles had affected the McKearney family. Three of Kevin's brothers had joined the IRA. In May 1974, his older brother Sean McKearney died when a bomb he was planting at a petrol station outside Dungannon exploded prematurely . In May 1987, his brother Patrick McKearney was one of eight IRA men killed by the SAS when they tried to attack Loughall police station in County Armagh. Last year, a HET report into that incident concluded that the IRA opened fire first. A third brother, Tommy McKearney, was jailed for his involvement in the killing of a part-time UDR soldier in 1976. Tommy McKearney spent 53 days on hunger strike in the Maze Prison, and now works as an author and freelance journalist. At the time of Kevin's death, his parents insisted that he had no paramilitary links. He had worked at the butchers shop since leaving school.

Its recommendations were agreed by all five political parties in the Scottish Parliament. The independence referendum was the first national vote in which 16 and 17-year-olds were able to take part. The chief counting officer for the referendum, Mary Pitcaithly, chairs the board that oversees election management in Scotland. She said: \"If changes of this significance are going to be made, the earlier that election professionals know about this the better, so that appropriate preparations can be made to minimise any risks\".

{"text": "After resuming on 48-1, in reply to table-topping Lancashire's 462, Glamorgan had slipped to 182-6 when the threatened downpour arrived 19.2 overs into the afternoon session. It leaves Glamorgan still 280 behind going into the final day. Their first target will be the 131 runs they still need to avoid the follow-on. The patience of Lancashire's bowlers was rewarded as the home side took five wickets, two of them for for Australian all-rounder James Faulkner and two for 41-year-old veteran Glen Chapple, who is now within 18 of reaching a career haul of 1,000 first-class wickets. Nightwatchman Andrew Salter was Glamorgan's top performer with 45 before being stumped by Alex Davies off Simon Kerrigan. Lancashire now need to take 14 wickets in the final three sessions if they are to win this Division Two promotion clash on Monday and take a major step closer to promotion back to Division One.

Jayden died in November after suffering 18 bone fractures as well as multiple brain and spinal injuries, a trial at Oxford Crown Court heard. Saxton, 21, was sentenced to nine years in prison. During the two-week trial, jurors heard the baby was living at a flat with his parents and had been left alone with Saxton on 17 November. They heard that Jayden never recovered from what the prosecution described as a \"violent assault\", in which he was squeezed so hard several of his ribs were broken. He was taken to hospital by paramedics, but died the following day. During the trial, Saxton told the court he had dialled 999 after Jayden stopped breathing and was in a state of panic because he thought something was stuck in his son's throat. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Rabinder Singh QC, said the baby's death was \"undoubtedly a tragedy for everyone concerned\". He told Saxton: \"No-one but you will ever know exactly what happened that afternoon. \"I conclude that you acted as you did in frustration at the fact that you could not settle Jayden.\" Det Ch Insp Kevin Brown of Thames Valley Police said Jayden's family had been through a \"living nightmare\" since November. \"The medical and forensic evidence in this investigation proved how Jayden was assaulted, causing him serious bodily harm that led to his death. \"The evidence was clear that Jordan committed manslaughter.\" Adrian Foster, chief prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it was \"impossible to imagine a more vulnerable victim\".

{"text": "Scientists are recruiting 64 healthy adult volunteers for the trial, which is expected to take up to two years. The work will be split equally between London, the Rwandan capital Kigali and Nairobi in Kenya. This early trial is being run by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit organisation. The principal investigator, Dr Jill Gilmour, who has worked at the laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since its founding in 2001, says she is optimistic that the Aids virus can eventually be tackled with a vaccine. The virus is now 30 years old, and the search for a vaccine has proved elusive so far. However, an American-backed trial in Thailand found in 2009 that a combination of two vaccine prototypes was 30% effective in preventing HIV infection. Follow-up trials are being planned with the aim of improving those initial results. In the IAVI trial, volunteers who are free of HIV and not at risk of catching the infection will receive a combination of two vaccines. One of them is derived from a weakened version of Sendai, a flu-like virus that infects rodents. It will be administered through nasal drops. This is because in the early stages of infection, both HIV and Sendai affect the mucosal tissues, which are found in the nose and also in the genital area. Dr Gilmour said: \"I believe it's not if, it's when we will have an effective HIV vaccine. There is now strong scientific data to support that position. \"We will get there but vaccine development takes time. It's not for the faint-hearted. \"Bear in mind that with polio, it was 45 years from discovering the virus to getting an effective vaccine. \"HIV is a formidable beast with sneaky tricks. It changes every time it divides, so it's highly variable. And it can integrate into your own cells, so your immune system can't see it.\" The trial is early work known as Phase I, meaning that the aim is to ensure the vaccine is safe and induces an immune response. Dr Gilmour added: \"Delivering the vaccine into the nose has public health benefits, because we're not using needles. \"If we see strong immune responses, we go into the larger second phase of testing whether the vaccine is effective in reducing transmission or lowering the load of the virus. \"The Sendai product is modified from a virus which affects rodents, including hamsters. From our perspective, it's a bonus that this virus has lived in the human environment without causing us harm.\" The IAVI laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster handles almost 100,000 blood samples a year and has supported more than 20 other vaccine trials. Its work includes sending test kits to sub-Saharan African countries at the heart of the Aids epidemic, carefully tracking the thousands of blood samples that it holds and ships elsewhere, and ensuring the data and paperwork from trials is rigorously monitored, so the results from different sets of tests can be pooled. Jason Warriner, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \"We welcome investment in the search for a vaccine against HIV. This research is in its very earliest stages. Clinical trials take several years to complete and, even if the vaccine passes this first stage of tests, more research will be needed over the course of many years. \"Although an HIV vaccine has so far remained stubbornly out of reach, we now understand how to prevent transmission better than ever before. \"A combination of widespread condom use, regular testing for HIV, and getting those with the virus onto the right treatment, could drastically reduce HIV within a generation.\"", "summary": "The world's first clinical trial of an HIV vaccine has begun.", "human_descriptions": ["The source text does not state it's the world's first,", "The source text doesn't say it is started, but that they're doing recruitment"], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 2675}

Initial worries centred around the wellbeing of her unborn baby, who was born by emergency C-section at 30 weeks. \"He was a little sleeping beauty after all of my chemotherapy,\" she said. \"He was safe because I had a reduced dose of the treatment, but it was decided that he had to come out early. \"Little Jesse was 3lb when he was born and his lungs were underdeveloped, but he fought to full health. \"I completed my treatment and life returned to pretty much normal.\" But after fighting off the disease once, it was to return in January this year. The cancer has now spread to Mrs Lennox's lungs, and her prognosis is not good. \"I am preparing to die,\" she told BBC News NI. \"It may sound morbid and I try not to make things too sad, but I believe it's important that the children know I won't be around forever. \"During my first round of treatment, I explained to them that I was sick and had to take medicine, but when it returned I knew I had to be more honest about the future. \"I've always been the type of mother who wants to protect her kids and to hide them from anything too upsetting. \"But now they know I won't be around to see them grown up and that I'm not going to get better. \"Obviously I was devastated when I got the news - it's not something any mother would want, but life can be taken away from you by cancer at any age. \"I don't have long left, but the kids get to go through some of the sadness they have ahead with me there to comfort them.\" As well as the memory boxes and leaving each child advice for the future, Mrs Lennox has been planning her funeral. \"I've sorted the grave, chosen my own coffin, written my eulogy and chosen the readings and hymns,\" she said. \"It's a strange experience, but my husband Alistair, 42, will have the four kids to look after when I'm gone, he doesn't need the stress of organising the funeral too.\" Mrs Lennox said she will make her final preparations in the coming days and then put it all to the side in order to spend the time she has left with her family. \"Christmas is my favourite time of year, so although I may not be there this year, we are going to make decorations together to hang around the house,\" she said.

{"text": "The Republican presidential nominee suggested on RT that Democrats were behind claims Russian intelligence agencies had hacked their computers. Mr Trump has faced a backlash since praising Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Wednesday night forum. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, accused him of being unpatriotic. Mr Trump was interviewed on Thursday night by Larry King, a former CNN host who now presents a show on RT America, a Russian-funded TV network. Trump and Putin: The new bromantics? When King asked him about reports that Russia is trying to disrupt the US election, Mr Trump was sceptical. \"I think it's probably unlikely,\" he said. \"I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out. \"I hope that if they are doing something, I hope that somebody's going to be able to find out, so they can end it, because that would not be appropriate at all.\" A Trump spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, suggested Mr Trump did not realise King's show was part of a Russian-backed network. \"Mr Trump recorded a short interview with Larry King for his podcast as a favour to Mr King,\" she said. Why Trump strikes a chord with Russians . \"What Larry King does with the interview content is up to him. We have nothing to do with it.\" Back in the late 1980s and 1990s, Larry King was a titan of US political media. A guest spot on his television call-in show provided current and aspiring candidates a way to reach a national audience in a low-stress, friendly environment. Donald Trump, back when he was just a larger-then-life real-estate developer and New York socialite, was a regular on King's programme. It's not entirely surprising then that the Republican nominee accepted an interview request from his long-time friend. That, however, is when Mr Trump's staff should have done a bit of research, found out the interview would be broadcast on RT and told their candidate to come up with a scheduling conflict and politely pull out. Given the heat Mr Trump has taken recently for showering praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian-owned RT is the last outlet he should be on. This is either another example of the Trump team's questionable advance work or - perhaps more troubling - its judgement. No matter the explanation, the story re-enforces the politically damaging perception that Mr Trump is uncomfortably chummy with the Russian government. Private cyber-security analysts have blamed Russian intelligence agencies for electronic break-ins into Democratic Party computers that emerged in leaks over the summer. Earlier this week Defence Secretary Ash Carter said the US would not ignore Russia's \"efforts to interfere with our democratic processes\". During a televised forum on Wednesday on national security, Mr Trump complimented Mr Putin for having \"great control over his country\". Mr Putin has offered kind words for Trump in the past, too, describing him as \"a talented man\". The Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, offered words of caution for Mr Trump on Thursday. \"One has to be a little careful to let flattery affect one's judgment,\" he told CNN. \"Let's face it, over the last several years, President Putin has operated in ways that very much have been against our interests.\" Mr Trump urged the Russians in July to hack into Mrs Clinton's emails to find messages that were deleted from her account amid an investigation into whether she abused state secrets. In a news conference on Thursday morning at a New York state airport, Mrs Clinton invoked conservatives' most revered US president as she pounced on Mr Trump's remarks. \"What would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks American generals and heaps praise on Russia's president?\" she asked.", "summary": "Donald Trump has appeared on a Russian-funded TV network.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 3349}
{"text": "The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines used. The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes. Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones. It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the West coast of the US, where waters are deep. \"This is a tech development project to ensure it's working in open sea conditions. It's a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,\" said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind. So far, one giant turbine has already been moved into place, while four more wait in readiness in a Norwegian fjord. By the end of the month they'll all have been towed to 15 miles off Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, where they'll float upright like giant fishing floats. While the turbines are currently very expensive to make, Statoil believes that in the future it will be able to dramatically reduce costs in the same way that manufacturers already have for conventional offshore turbines. \"I think eventually we will see floating wind farms compete without subsidy - but to do that we need to get building at scale,\" said Mr Delp. The operation to begin shifting the first of the 11,500 tonne giants happened dramatically in the half-light of a Norwegian summer night. Crews secured thick cables to tug boats and used remote-controlled submarines to check for obstacles. Finally the giant was on the move, floating on a sealed vase-like tube 78 metres deep, its bottom filled with iron ore to weight the base and keep it upright in the water. The price of energy from bottom-standing offshore wind farms has plummeted 32% since 2012 - far faster that anyone predicted. The price is now four years ahead of the government's expected target, and another big price drop is expected, taking offshore wind to a much lower price than new nuclear power. The Hywind project is being run in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi firm Masdar. The \u00c2\u00a3190m cost was subsidised by bill-payers under the UK government's Renewable Obligation Certificates. The bird charity RSPB Scotland opposed the project - not because it dislikes the technology but because it believes too many offshore turbines in the area have already been approved. It fears thousands of sea birds may be killed by the offshore wind farms, although it admits that estimates are hugely uncertain because it is impossible to count bird corpses at sea. The RSPB's Aidan Smith told BBC News: \"Generally we are very enthusiastic about floating wind technology because it allows turbines to be placed far offshore - away from seabird nesting sites, and it helps us tackle climate change. \"We oppose the Hywind project because it adds to a situation we already believe is a problem.\" Floating turbines may create a new frontier for energy - but scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warn far more investment in additional new technologies is urgently needed for governments to keep promises on reducing emissions.

Hull could not afford to lose after Swansea had opened a four-point gap with a 2-0 win at Sunderland. Swansea's survival marks a remarkable turnaround in fortunes under Paul Clement. Clement, Swansea's third manager of the season after Bob Bradley and Franceso Guidolin, took over a side in January that was bottom with only 12 points from 19 game. The former Derby County manager's arrival at the Liberty Stadium saw an initial revival with Swansea winning three of his first five games in charge. But between the beginning of March and mid-April the Swans claimed only a single point in six Premier League games. Swansea's 2-0 home win over Stoke City on 22 April was the start of a three-match unbeaten run which boosted their hopes of escaping relegation. Their 1-0 home victory over Everton saw them leapfrog Marco Silva's Hull, who had lost 2-0 at home to Sunderland earlier on Saturday, 7 May. And Swansea extended their unbeaten run to four games with a win in their penultimate game at already relegated Sunderland, which opened a four-point gap between the Welsh side and 18th-placed Hull.

He is thought to be among the dead. The hunt is on for possible accomplices. Russian officials suspect that he had links to so-called Islamic State (IS). So far few details have emerged about Jalilov. There are unconfirmed reports that he was an ethnic Uzbek. Russia's State Investigative Committee said \"an explosive device could have been detonated by a man whose body parts were found in the third carriage of the train.\" \"The man has been identified but his identity will not be disclosed for now in the interests of the investigation,\" the statement added. The bomb blew up in a train carriage which had just left Sennaya Ploshchad station. The driver managed to continue to Tekhnologichesky Institut station. Later a similar device was found propped up against a wall at another city metro station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya. The Russian news website Gazeta.ru reports that the bombs were concealed in car fire extinguishers, with ball bearings taped to the outside. The one which exploded is said to have been carried in a rucksack. Reports say Jalilov had been living in St Petersburg for six years and had used several passports. He had worked as a chef in a St Petersburg sushi restaurant, Gazeta reported. Kyrgyz investigators are working with Russian authorities on the case. Reuters news agency spoke to people in Osh who said Jalilov was from an ethnic Uzbek family. They said they knew his parents but had not seen him for years. They said his father worked as a panel-beater in a car repair shop. IS has recruited many Islamist militants from Central Asian republics and from Chechnya in the North Caucasus. Russian aircraft and cruise missiles have targeted IS and other rebel groups in Syria - a vital intervention for embattled Syrian government forces.

Headlined \"Call me names but gay is NOT OKAY\", it caused an uproar at the time. Mr Qwelane, who was appointed last year to Uganda where homosexual acts are illegal, did not mount a defence. Correspondents say the outcome of the case is particularly significant in the light of the recent attacks and rapes of lesbian women in South Africa. Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships. \"We are hoping really that this finding will send a message to community members, a message that says gay and lesbian people have an equal right to the protection of their dignity,\" said Vincent Moaga, spokesman for the South African Human Rights Commission, which initiated the complaint against Mr Qwelane. The Sunday Sun officially apologised for the column following complaints after its publication, but Mr Qwelane refused to make an apology. The court agreed with commission's argument that Mr Qwelane's article, and the cartoon accompanying it, had promoted hatred against homosexuals, causing them emotional suffering. Mr Moaga said the money from the fine would be donated to gay rights organisations. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Qwelane was appointed as ambassador last year, raising concerns that he would fuel tensions in Uganda which has come under intense international pressure over plans to tighten laws against homosexuality. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, first introduced in 2009 and yet to be voted on in Uganda's parliament, seeks to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in prison to life. It also proposes the death penalty for a new offence of \"aggravated homosexuality\" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\".", "summary": "The Ugandan ambassador to South Africa has been found guilty of hate speech for a column in the Sunday Sun newspaper.", "human_descriptions": ["The source text does not mention Jon Qwelane's job title."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 1578}

Mr McEvoy, a Plaid AM for South Wales Central and the party's group leader on Cardiff council, is facing a tribunal over allegations he brought the authority into disrepute in his role as a local councillor. BBC Wales reported in January that the case, referred to the tribunal by the Ombudsman, apparently relates to whether a comment was made to a council officer in a threatening way. In a letter to the panel, Mr Clubb said the Fairwater councillor \"will be speaking at the conference and we would not wish his speech to be disturbed either by his appearance at a panel or by his having to prepare for an imminent hearing\". He said the case \"could have been heard at almost any point in November through February on a date that would not have conflicted with a critical date in the political calendar\". Mr Clubb, who has served as Plaid's chief executive since last September, said timetabling the hearing for the day of the conference gave the \"appearance of political interference, even if the date clash is entirely coincidental. \"I fear that scheduling Mr McEvoy's case to coincide with our spring conference fails this test and could lead to an erosion in public trust in the work of the panel.\" In the letter Mr Clubb suggests it could be seen \"that the panel is trying to unfairly prevent [Mr McEvoy's] appearance at conference\". He said an \"impartial decision\" would rightly determine that the \"proposed date is manifestly unfair to Mr McEvoy\".

{"text": "Several Australian bars have dumped Coopers Brewery after it was featured by religious group the Bible Society. The video shows two MPs debating their opposing views on same-sex marriage - which is not legal in Australia - as they clutch Coopers beers. It has led to claims Coopers is against marriage equality, a claim it denies. The backlash has gathered pace in recent days and, by Tuesday, a string of drinking spots in favour of same-sex marriage had boycotted the brand. The Bible Society posted the \"Keeping It Light\" video on Thursday. It features conservative MPs Tim Wilson (for same-sex marriage) and Andrew Hastie (against) debating the issue in what they call a \"civil and respectful way\". Coopers has since claimed it \"did not give permission\" to be included in the video. However, the brand recently celebrated the Bible Society's 200-year anniversary with a commemorative beer featuring Bible verses. In the video, Mr Wilson argues: \"I believe that it would be sensible to change the act that deals with issues around civil marriage to include two people regardless of their gender.\" Mr Hastie counters: \"I'm for retaining the current definition of marriage, which is between a man and a woman.\" Despite Mr Wilson's inclusion, critics interpreted the video as one-sided. One commentator said Coopers risked sponsoring a \"political act by a religious organisation\", while another said \"homophobia lite is still homophobia\". \"I have respected Coopers all my life, and it was crushing to realise that as a queer person, they don't respect me,\" wrote Chloe Sargeant for the Special Broadcasting Service. Opposition to the video has picked up steam since the weekend. By Tuesday, at least eight drinking spots in Sydney and Melbourne had publicly declared they would not stock Coopers. One widely shared video showed two people throwing full bottles in the bin. Luke Hiscox, from Sydney's Union Hotel, which plans to take Coopers off tap, said people were upset by the phrase \"keeping it light\". \"That irks people because for them it's not in the slightest a light topic,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think they really realised what they were saying.\" Another venue, The Old Bar in Melbourne, said it would boycott Coopers because it was \"very obvious that our values are at odds\". In a statement, Cooper said it was not \"trying to push a religious message\" with its commemorative beer range. It maintained it had not sponsored the video. \"We respect the beliefs of our community and do not wish to try and change them,\" the company said. In a subsequent statement, it said it had cancelled the release of its Bible Society commemorative cans and would be joining Australian Marriage Equality. \"\"Our company supports marriage equality,\" Director of Corporate Affairs Melanie Cooper said. Bible Society chief executive Greg Clarke said the video sought to have a \"civil conversation on a serious issue\". \"At first I was surprised the reaction was so immediate and extreme, but then on reflection [I] wasn't surprised because this really seems to be how social media works at the moment,\" he told the BBC. Mr Wilson has described the boycott as absurd, saying it only proves the value of the discussion. \"I'm disappointed Coopers appears to have distanced themselves from a sensible conversation that they should be proud to align themselves with,\" he told news.com.au. Advertising commentator Jane Caro agreed the video was not promoting a view. She said same-sex marriage advocates were often suspicious of religious messaging. \"They have lost patience and lost tolerance for the idea that there should be mutual respect on both sides,\" Ms Caro told the BBC. \"I think Coopers have probably inadvertently found themselves in the eye of the storm.\"", "summary": "A popular Australian beer brand is facing a backlash over a controversial video on same-sex marriage.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary makes up that the beer brand is popular"], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 2921}

{"text": "Produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the guidelines recommend women seek advice well before pregnancy on their care. Managing seizure control, tiredness and risks linked to some epilepsy medicines can make pregnancy a difficult time. Epilepsy Action said the guidance would help women make informed decisions. Around 2,500 infants are estimated to be born to women with epilepsy every year in the UK. But there are risks to the health of unborn babies from taking some anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy, particularly sodium valproate. Some women stop taking their medication or cut down, which can make seizures worse and increase the risk of harm to mother and baby. However, the guidance says \"most mothers have normal healthy babies\", but women with epilepsy should be informed that the risk to the foetus is dependent on the type, number and doses of drug they take. These RCOG guidelines, for GPs, midwives, consultants and women with the condition, say women should: . It's a condition that affects the brain, leading to epileptic seizures. A seizure happens when there is a sudden burst of intense electrical activity in the brain. This causes a temporary disruption to the way the brain normally works. There are many different types of seizure. During the more serious ones, the person can lose awareness, go stiff, fall to the floor and the body can jerk. Some types of epilepsy last for a limited time and the person eventually stops having seizures. But for many people epilepsy is a life-long condition. Shakila Thangaratinam, lead author of the guidelines and professor of maternal and perinatal health at Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, said the right care before, during and after pregnancy was important. \"Women with epilepsy require multi-disciplinary care throughout their pregnancy, and healthcare professionals need to be aware of the small but significant increase in risks. \"While most women who have epilepsy remain free of seizures throughout their pregnancy, some may have more seizures if they are pregnant. \"It is important that these women receive pre-conception counselling, meet with an epilepsy specialist, and are monitored closely for seizure risk factors.\" Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive at Epilepsy Action, said he was delighted to see the guidance published. \"This ensures that they are able to make informed decisions about all aspects of their health and wellbeing, as well as that of their baby.\" Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, also welcomed the guidance. \"It is vital we remember that women with epilepsy are classified as high risk during their pregnancy, often they require more monitoring and specialist care during the course of their pregnancy. However, the majority of women with epilepsy will give birth safely.\" Experts say the risk of death is 10 times greater in pregnant women with epilepsy compared with those without the condition. Between 2009 and 2013, 21 women died during pregnancy as a result of epilepsy - and in most of those cases their seizures were found to be poorly controlled.", "summary": "Pregnant women with epilepsy should be aware of the risks to their baby, new guidelines say.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1735}

Until January, he was head of Iran's wealthy social welfare organisation but was removed under pressure from the Majlis - Iran's parliament. Mr Mortazavi, 45, was placed under US sanctions in 2010. He and other officials were accused by Washington of \"sustained and severe violations of human rights\". By Mohammad ManzarpourBBC Persian . Saeed Mortazavi's arrest could be considered a turning point in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's tenure as Iran's Supreme Leader. Having risen from obscurity as a young judge, Mr Mortazavi was instrumental in the mass culling of reformist newspapers during former President Mohammad Khatami's administration. He later gained further notoriety for his involvement in the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist who died in custody following her arrest in 2003. More recently, Mr Mortazavi was accused in connection with the abuse and killing of post-election protesters in the Kahrizak detention centre. It is unlikely that Mr Mortazavi's arrest could have come without the supreme leader's approval. Whatever red-line Mr Mortazavi may have crossed to trigger this chain of events, his arrest marks the end of an era of impunity, long enjoyed by the Islamic state's most loyal enforcers. Analysts say his arrest could be the result of disputes between President Ahmadinejad on one hand and parliament and the judiciary on the other. The arrest was \"possibly\" in connection with allegations of torture and the deaths of prisoners after the controversial 2009 election, Fars reported. A few days after he was removed last month as head of the social welfare fund, he was rehired by President Ahmadinejad, but this time as official caretaker of the same organisation, angering some lawmakers. While defending the former prosecutor in parliament, Mr Ahmadinejad accused the head of parliament and the head of the judiciary of corruption, which analysts say might be one of the reasons behind Mr Mortazavi's arrest. Mr Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election in 2009 - and the violent suppression of subsequent opposition protests - has widened the rift between conservatives and reformists within Iran's political establishment. Correspondents say parliament has been hostile to Mr Ahmadinejad for most of his second four-year term which expires in August.

There have been repeated allegations of abuses of Rohingya people since a military counter-insurgency campaign was launched in Rakhine in October. Some have even said the state's actions amount to ethnic cleansing, and Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, has faced international criticism. Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? Nobel laureates urge action on Rohingya . The commission, set up by the Myanmar government and led by a former general, Myint Swe, is due to make its final conclusions before the end of January. But, in its interim findings, it dismissed allegations of genocide on the basis that there are still Rohingya Muslims living in Rakhine and that Islamic religious buildings have not been destroyed. It said it had so far found \"insufficient evidence\" that anyone had been raped by security forces, despite widespread claims. Accusations of arson, arbitrary arrest and torture are still being investigated. Strangely, the commission made no mention of the most serious claim - that Burmese security forces have been killing civilians as collective punishment for attacks by Rohingya militants, the BBC's Myanmar correspondent Jonah Fisher reports. Three months since this crisis began, little progress appears to have been made to solve it, he notes. The report says hundreds of Rohingya have been arrested but armed militants are still moving around easily and that looted weapons have yet to be recovered. Earlier in the week, several police were detained after a video surfaced appearing to show officers beating Rohingya Muslims during a security operation in November. The admission that security forces may have carried out abuses is an unusual development, as leaders have previously insisted they are following the rule of law. Rakhine state is closed to journalists and investigators, making it difficult to independently verify any allegations. The estimated one million Muslim Rohingya are seen by many in mainly Buddhist Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. They are denied citizenship by the government despite tracing their ancestry back generations. Communal violence in Rakhine state in 2012 left scores dead and displaced more than 100,000 people, with many Rohingya still remaining in decrepit camps. They face widespread discrimination and mistreatment. Hundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya are estimated to live in Bangladesh, having fled Myanmar over decades. Bangladesh says around 50,000 Rohingya have crossed its border over the past two months. The situation has drawn global condemnation.

{"text": "It wants to redress the balance from the university's walls being lined with pictures of \"dead white males\" by adding more women and ethnic minorities. The portraits include broadcasters Dame Esther Rantzen and Reeta Chakrabarti. Oxford's head of equality Trudy Coe said it was \"sending a signal\". This commissioning of portraits is one of the biggest projects by the university to create a more diverse range of people portrayed in its public places - including more women, people from ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians and people with disabilities. The university faced a high-profile controversy last year over whether a statue of Cecil Rhodes should be removed - after claims that the Victorian colonialist's attitudes on race made him an unsuitable figure to be commemorated. The new pictures on the ancient walls will include scientist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and author Jeanette Winterson. There will also be some men, including film maker Ken Loach. \"We're not taking anyone down - but the portraits have been almost exclusively men and we're just beginning to redress the balance,\" says Ms Coe, head of the university's equality and diversity unit. \"It will allow students to look up and see people who look like them. It's sending a signal to a wider range of students that they belong here,\" she says. Ms Coe says the new pictures will reflect the modern reality of university life - and the people who have been painted or photographed have been nominated by current staff and students. The people depicted have links with the university - such as being former students or academic staff - with the criteria that they were examples of excellence and widened the range of pictures from the \"narrow and traditional\" and \"challenged stereotypes\". Among the people to be represented will be criminologist and disability rights campaigner, Marie Tidball. \"Symbols are important,\" she said. There are millions of people with a disability in the UK, Ms Tidball said, but they have a \"lack of visibility in public spaces\". The commissioning of a picture of an academic with a disability was a \"very significant\" step towards making sure that all kinds of students could feel at home at the university, she said. \"I really hope that this speaks to kids now doing their GCSEs,\" said Ms Tidball. And she rejected suggestions of an excess of political correctness as \"absolute nonsense\". BBC journalist Reeta Chakrabarti said it was a project which reflected the university's current staff and living alumni. These are people who are \"alive and kicking, a representation of modern day Britain,\" she said. \"You could just continue to portray the same people, but it wouldn't be a reflection of how the university and society have changed,\" she said. \"Different ages, different societies celebrate different values.\" As a student at Oxford, she said \"there weren't many people there who were like me, from my sort of background\". But she had an \"overwhelmingly positive experience\" and \"nothing about Oxford made me feel out of place\". Oxford University has faced questions about whether it is admitting enough poorer students and state-school pupils. Admissions figures published earlier this year showed that Oxford had one of the lowest proportions of state school pupils of any UK university. This showed that universities such as Bristol, Durham and Cambridge were admitting a higher proportion of state school pupils than Oxford.

It means they decide not to impose tariffs (taxes on imports) on each other's goods and agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area. The key argument for leaving the customs union is that it will allow the UK to negotiate its own trade agreements.

Liverpool's Callum Smith stayed on course for a world title shot with a brutal 10th-round knockout of game Lancastrian Luke Blackledge. Referee Steve Gray could have stopped the fight earlier but allowed the one-sided battering to continue until Blackledge was knocked unconscious. There were an anxious few minutes as a prone Blackledge was administered oxygen before he gingerly, and mercifully, made it back to his feet. Smith, 26, successfully defended his British title for the first time and remained unbeaten in 22 pro fights, with 17 knockouts. He is ranked number one by the WBC but Sweden's Badou Jack is defending that belt against Britain's IBF champion James DeGale in January. In a thrilling light-heavyweight contest, Frank Buglioni stopped Hosea Burton in the 12th and final round to secure the British title. Manchester's Burton, 28, built an early lead behind his jab and some ramrod right hands, and the challenger's face was a bloody mess by the middle rounds. However, the Londoner's punches started to have an effect down the stretch and Burton went down under a barrage in the 11th. Midway through the 12th, Burton was stunned by a right to the temple before going down again. He clambered to his feet but the referee called things off after another assault by Buglioni, with a minute and four seconds remaining. Buglioni, 27, improves to 19 wins (15 KOs) and two defeats from 22 pro fights and could be rewarded with a second shot at a world title.

The charity, WildAid, told the BBC they wanted people to stop waiting for government action to fix the problem. \"We wanted to find some humorous way to talk about the very serious problem we are facing,\" said WildAid's China representative, May Mei. Hairy Nose shows a parade of stylish Chinese people - and one dog - sporting elaborately groomed nasal hair as they go about their daily lives in the \"putrid, choking air and the never ending smog\".

Ms Mei said WildAid wanted to tell people to stop waiting for the government to take action on pollution and climate change, and instead come up with their own creative ways to be more green. \"A lot of people complain about pollution in Beijing and Shanghai, but no-one really knows what you can do,\" she said. \"What we want to say is that change is not that difficult, it should come from everyone.\" She suggested that 35% of Beijing's pollution comes from transport fumes, so cycling or walking would make a real difference.

{"text": "Researchers say the huge predator had scales much like modern reptiles rather than feathers or fluff. The dinosaur may have ditched its feathers because it no longer needed insulation when it reached gigantic proportions, they propose. But the findings are unlikely to end the long-running debate about the physical appearance of T. rex. We don't need to throw out the image of a big fluffy T. rex quite yet, argued one palaeontologist. Whether T.rex was clad in scales, feathers or both, has long been a mystery, largely due to a lack of fossil evidence. Primitive feathers have been identified in some members of the Tyrannosaur group, leading to speculation that the king of reptiles also sported feathers. In the latest twist, researchers analysed skin impressions from a T.rex skeleton known as Wyrex, unearthed in Montana. They also looked at relatives that roamed during the Late Cretaceous in Asia and other parts of North America, including Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus. Skin patches from the neck, pelvis and tail of Wyrex show scaly, reptilian-like skin, says a team led by Dr Phil Bell of the University of New England, Australia. Writing in the journal, Biology Letters, they say fossil integument (outer covering) from T.rex and other members of the group confirm that \"these large-bodied forms possessed scaly reptilian-like skin.' The researchers think the giant tyrannosaurs lost their feathers over time because they no longer needed them as insulation. But not all researchers are convinced. Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh said he wouldn't be surprised if T. rex lost or reduced its feathers, as it was a very big animal, just like elephants reduce their hair. Asian elephants are hairier than African elephants because they are smaller and live in dense forests in dim sunlight. \"But I don't think we can assume that T. rex lacked feathers just because some fossil skeletons have skin impressions that are scaly,\" he added. \"It takes inconceivable good luck to preserve feathers in fossils. Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they weren't there. So I don't think we need to throw out the image of a big fluffy T. rex quite yet.\" The Tyrannosaurs were fearsome predators during the last part of the Cretaceous, 85 to 65 million years ago. They were known for their sharp teeth, small beady eyes and tiny forelimbs (arms). The group included Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus, as well as the iconic T. rex.

{"text": "The shadow chancellor told the BBC Jeremy Corbyn had shown leadership by insisting the referendum result must be honoured and the UK should leave. But he said Labour would not back a \"kamikaze\" exit which hurt the economy. Some shadow ministers have suggested they would quit if forced to vote for kick-starting official EU exit talks. Dozens of Labour MPs who support remaining in the EU could be willing to defy the leadership if it whips them into voting for Brexit in the event of a Commons vote which could take place in the coming weeks. The government has said it will notify the EU of its decision to leave, beginning two years of talks about the terms of exit, by the end of March. Whether Parliament is asked to approve the Article 50 decision hinges on a Supreme Court ruling, due on Tuesday, into whether MPs and peers are required to have their say. The Labour leadership have been accused of \"dithering\" over their approach and are under pressure to clarify whether they will oppose the government's plan of leaving the single market and the customs union and restricting EU migration. Mr McDonnell said the debate was polarised between those who wanted to overturn the referendum result and, on the other hand, those who backed a so-called hard Brexit and saw the UK's future outside the EU as a virtual tax haven. Labour, he suggested, stood between these two poles and supported a negotiated settlement with the EU to protect jobs, wages and living standards. \"Jeremy Corbyn has taken a rather courageous position in that he recognises that you have to bring the country together at some stage and it will be over a traditional British compromise,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. \"Somewhere along the line there will be a sensible compromise and it will be Labour that is driving that compromise.\" Asked whether Labour MPs would be whipped to support the Article 50 process, he said the opposition had made it clear all along the referendum vote must be honoured. But he said Labour would seek to amend any government plans to guarantee the fullest scrutiny in Parliament and enable MPs from all parties to \"influence the negotiations\". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Corbyn said he would \"ask\" Labour MPs to respect the result while asked explicitly whether Labour wanted to stay in the single market, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the BBC's Sunday Politics that \"in terms of jobs and the economy, of course we should be\". Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now the party's Brexit spokesman, said Labour had suffered a \"catastrophic loss of nerve\" over Europe. \"This absolute lack of clarity from Labour on the biggest issue of our times - dithering helplessly in the middle of the road - is only going to make their fate even worse.\" While he expected ministers to win any vote on Article 50, he told Andrew Marr he expected Theresa May to run into trouble if she \"digs her heels in\" in during the talks. The Lib Dems are pushing for the deal negotiated by Mrs May to be put to a referendum, saying the government had no mandate to \"yank\" the UK out of the single market. \"Whether we like it or not the single market, the biggest destination of our goods and services, is a market place of rules,\" he added. \"So even if we are out of it, we will have to abide by those rules. Once I think that becomes clear, the British public will start having some doubts.\" The Conservatives, which have promised Parliament a vote on the final deal, said Labour remained \"hopelessly divided and confused\". \"They can't agree over whether we should leave the single market and have said they will also find new ways of frustrating the process of leaving,\" said Tory MP Maria Caulfield.", "summary": "Labour will be driving a \"sensible compromise\" in the Brexit debate, John McDonnell has said.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary makes up McDonnell's first name"], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3280}

In his latest video, entitled The Greatest Century, he strikes a very optimistic note, saying: \"I see a great country on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead.\" The Bush team may have hoped their man would have built a clear lead in the polls by now, but the consensus view is he's currently just one in a pack of frontrunners. Recent interviews with campaign strategists indicate that they are going to start using the millions of dollars at their disposal to target opponents they consider most threatening - namely, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. In his opening campaign video, Mr Bush emphasised his positive, optimistic vision for the future, saying some politicians \"talk about problems; I see solutions\". But in the coming months, the fight for the Republican presidential nomination could get nasty. Although his campaign becomes official on Monday, it's been no secret for many months and his team is well on the way to raising a $100m war chest. During a tour of Europe last week, Mr Bush warned he would not waver from his core beliefs, even if some are unpopular in his party. \"I'm not going to change who I am,\" he said. \"I respect people who may not agree with me, but I'm not going to change my views because today someone has a view that's different.\" In a separate video, called Making A Difference, he champions the rights of women, ethnic minorities and the disabled. \"My core beliefs start with the premise that the most vulnerable in our society should be in the front of the line and not the back,'' he says. \"What we need is new leadership that takes conservative principles and applies them so that people can rise up.\" Profile: Jeb Bush .

{"text": "Greece is now part way through its third eurozone bailout programme, worth up to 86bn euros (\u00c2\u00a374bn). The programme has encountered repeated delays as the lenders monitor compliance with policy conditions. Technical officials are expected to return to Athens soon to complete the negotiations. The \"in principle\" deal, as European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici called it, was agreed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Malta. The main elements in the latest agreement are commitments to reduce spending on pensions from 2019 and to collect more income tax from 2020 by lowering the tax-free threshold. Together the two measures are intended to improve the Greek government's finances by the equivalent of 2% of the country's economic activity, or GDP. To sweeten a pill that will be unpopular in Greece, the other eurozone countries agreed that Athens would be able take other measures to stimulate the economy, if the government finances perform better than expected. The next step is that technical experts from three European institutions and the IMF will return to Athens to try to negotiate the remaining details. The Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs eurozone ministers' meetings, called for them to put the last dots on the i's and reach a full agreement as soon as possible at staff level - that's the staff of the institutions involved in monitoring the programme. That is needed before there is political decision to make that delayed payment. Once there is a staff agreement, Mr Dijsselbloem said that the Eurogroup ministers would also look at the targets Greece would need to aim for in the government finances after the last bailout payments are made (due in 2018) and the question of debt sustainability - which means debt relief beyond what the eurozone has already provided. Debt relief previously has been in the form of reduced interest rates and longer payment periods, rather than reducing the amount of the principal sum that must ultimately be repaid. Further debt relief is likely to be in a similar form. Eurozone ministers have said it many times and it's politically more difficult for them with domestic political audiences if they were to explicitly write off a chunk of what they have lent. The International Monetary Fund has long argued that Greece needs more debt relief. That has been behind its reluctance to contribute financially to the third bailout. (It did chip in to the first two). Its involvement in the third so far is as an adviser and monitor of Greek performance. The rest of the eurozone, but especially Germany, would like the IMF to put some money in. That's not so much for the sake of reducing the eurozone contribution as for the better credibility they think the programme would have if the IMF did stump up some money. But IMF staff are so far unwilling to even recommend it to their board, which is made up of representatives of the agency's member countries. After the Malta meeting, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said: \"We are at a point where we think there are good prospects for successfully concluding discussions on these outstanding policy issues during the next mission to Athens. \"Such an agreement on policies will have to be followed by discussions with euro-area countries to ensure satisfactory assurances on a credible strategy to restore debt sustainability, before a programme is presented to the IMF executive board.\" The key deadline for the next instalment from the eurozone is July. Greece needs additional funds for debt payments that fall due. In Athens, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said: \"The Greek economy is ready to leave the crisis behind it.\" But there is a lot of scepticism about that. Hugo Dixon of BreakingViews says that the current discussion will only buy Greece some more time, until mid-2018.

And the sharp contraction in the economy in the final three months of 2013 was revised to show that it shrank less than thought, by 0.1% rather than 2.3%. The GDP recalculation does not affect the growth figures, because previous years have also been recalculated. In October's budget, Finance Minister Michael Noonan outlined 2bn euros ($2.7bn) programme of tax hikes and spending cuts to meet a deficit target of 3% of GDP by the end of next year. Last month, he suggested that the enlargement of GDP under the new EU rules could mean the programme might be reined back, as the debt and deficit will appear smaller when measured against the new \"larger\" economy . Conall Mac Coille, chief economist at Davy Group, Ireland's biggest securities firm, estimated that the new numbers meant Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 116% and its deficit at 6.7% of GDP at the end of last year . Previously, those figures had been 123.7% and 7.2%. He said: \"It's a measurement issue rather than a real improvement.

{"text": "The meeting, at Mr Putin's summer residence in Sochi, comes at a low point in bilateral relations over the war in Syria and Russia's annexation of Crimea. They are expected to discuss both issues during their meeting - but no breakthroughs are expected. Mr Putin will then meet Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday. Ties between Russia and Germany have worsened since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, with Germany being a driving force behind the EU sanctions imposed in response. The pair, who are among the most powerful world leaders, have crossed paths at international summits recently. But this meeting - with the official purpose of discussing the G20 summit of world leaders to be held in Hamburg in July - is the first trip Mrs Merkel has made to Russia in two years. Mrs Merkel wants Russia to seek an end to the conflict in Ukraine by using its influence on pro-Russian separatists, and also needs Moscow's co-operation to bring peace to Syria, the BBC correspondent in Berlin, Damien McGuinness, says. But President Putin equally needs Mrs Merkel's support in to lift the EU's sanctions, our correspondent adds. Mr Putin is also keen to hear her opinion of US President Donald Trump, whom she recently met. The pair spoke frequently before the breakdown in communications since 2014, and were said to have a grudging respect for one another. She speaks Russian, having grown up in communist East Germany, and he speaks German, from his years working for the KGB in Dresden in the 1980s. Russian news outlet Tass said the pair would discuss terrorism, the Middle East, and the Minsk agreements on the Ukraine crisis, quoting a Kremlin press source. But both sides have downplayed the prospect of major breakthroughs during their meeting in Sochi. Germany remains critical of Russia's actions in Crimea in 2014, and the two leaders stand opposed on the war in Syria. The German domestic intelligence agency has also accused Russia of being behind a series of cyber attacks on state computer systems. In contrast, Mr Putin's scheduled meeting with the Turkish president the following day comes at a time of increased co-operation between the two nations. While they back opposing sides in Syria's civil war - with Moscow supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Ankara his opponents - the two countries began carrying out joint air strikes against the so-called Islamic State in January. The joint operation came a little over a year after Turkey shot down a Russian military jet, resulting in a crisis in bilateral relations.

{"text": "Bertie Acheson, who was 72, died after a confrontation with the intruder at his home in Glenmore Gardens, Coleraine, in April 2012. Paul James Manolito Toland, originally of The Cedars, Antrim, had pleaded guilty to Mr Acheson's manslaughter. After his release he must serve a further four and half years on licence. Toland, a father of four, has 18 previous convictions for burglary. He was confronted by his victim after he broke into the couple's home to steal money. There was a struggle and Mr Acheson, who cared for his disabled wife Sheila, suffered a heart attack and died on his kitchen floor. Speaking after the sentencing, the senior investigating officer in the case said the Acheson family had been left \"devastated\" by his loss, particularly his widow. Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison said the fact that Toland was sentenced on what would have been Mr Acheson's 75th birthday had a \"double impact\" on the pensioner's loved ones. \"A person who I deem to be dangerous has now been taken off the streets and people can now feel safe in their homes,\" the officer said. \"Paul Toland was a predator. He preyed on the vulnerable and elderly and equally infirm couple who had been married for 44 years. His actions resulted in the death of Bertie Acheson, for just over \u00c2\u00a3300.\" An earlier court hearing was told that the couple were woken up by the sound of breaking glass in the early hours of 20 April 2012. Mr Acheson went to investigate. His widow later told police she overheard a verbal altercation between her husband and an intruder, during which money was demanded. Mrs Acheson claimed she also heard the sound of a scuffle and gasping for breath. She managed to raise the alarm, but when ambulance personnel and police arrived at the scene, her husband was already dead. Toland had originally been charged with Mr Acheson's murder, but at a court hearing in October, a defence lawyer asked that his client be re-arraigned. Toland told Belfast Crown Court that he was not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He also admitted the robbery of Mrs Acheson, who had \u00c2\u00a3335 stolen from her purse during the burglary. Det Ch Insp Harrison paid tribute to the courage and resilience of the pensioner's family throughout the \"long and protracted inquiry\". The officer said that Toland had been in the couple's house the previous month to repair a vacuum cleaner and had been paid in cash. \"We believe that Toland's greed brought him back to the house in the expectation that he could break in and steal whatever cash he could get his hands on,\" Det Ch Insp Harrison added.

Many customers found their debit cards were declined and about 3,500 ATMs were not working for three hours. The technical fault has now been fixed, and the banking group has apologised to those affected. The hardware failure came on a normal day for the banking group, it said. \"We were in 'business as usual' mode - and there was no maintenance or update activity on the system at the time,\" said a spokeswoman for Lloyds. By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter, BBC News . This is not the first bank to suffer from a computer failure, and it certainly won't be the last. New technology will put even more strain on the banks' creaking IT systems, which were built to run a very different banking system decades ago. So how do we cope as consumers? The irony is that the more we embrace the digital wallet, the more emergency cash we may need to carry for when these systems crash. \"We are working with our suppliers to understand what caused the hardware failure, but there is no evidence that it was as a result of an external intervention or attack on our systems. \"We continually review and update our systems as necessary and make significant investment to do this.\" The chief executive of TSB, Paul Pester, said on Sunday that its customers' debit card transactions had been affected after problems with two out of seven IT servers. He tweeted an apology and replied to some comments personally. Lloyds Banking Group serves about 30 million customers and is the largest retail banking group in the UK. TSB has about five million UK customers and is in the process of being split from Lloyds Banking Group. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, said it had been in contact with Lloyds and would be updated on how customers had been affected. Not everyone who tried to use their cards suffered problems, and Lloyds said that online customers were unaffected. UK banks have suffered a series of IT problems over the past few years. In December, an estimated 750,000 customers at the Royal Bank of Scotland group were unable to use their credit and debit cards for several hours. Leanne Seaward, 29, from Verwood in Dorset, said she discovered she had problems when she went to pay for her weekly supermarket shop at about 16.15 GMT on Sunday. \"It was a little embarrassing, I put my card in and it kept saying transaction void. I thought it was because I am in the process of switching banks, so assumed they might have closed my account without telling me. \"Luckily I had my husband with me so he was able to pay, but if I was getting petrol and on my own it could have been a completely different matter.\" Your experiences . A week later, NatWest - which is part of the group - said that it was hit by a cyber attack. A deliberate attempt to disrupt services by creating a surge in traffic - known as a distributed denial of service attack - meant some customers struggled to access online banking. In 2012, a major IT failure locked many RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers out of their accounts for several days. The issue was particularly bad for Ulster Bank, with customers facing access problems for weeks. Most banks have seen online and card failures in recent years, with many of the computer systems being used dating back decades. TechUK, a trade body for a number of technology companies, said: \"It is now widely acknowledged that the technology infrastructure across many financial institutions is exceptionally complex, to the point where it no longer serves many banks, it hinders them. \"However many financial institutions are unable to address these issues because of the sheer cost and disruption that replacing these systems would entail.\"", "summary": "Thousands of customers of Lloyds and TSB were unable to use their debit and credit cards on Sunday.", "human_descriptions": ["The source text does not say how many customers were affected", "Credit cards were not mentioned as being affected in the Lloyds event", "It was not mentioned that the Lloyds event occurred on Sunday.", " The summary states that TSB customers were unable to use their debit and credit cards, but the text specifies that TSB's issues were related to two out of seven IT servers and does not confirm that thousands of TSB customers were affected.

{"text": "She also understands why athletes get into trouble because \"sometimes your mind isn't 100% as all you're thinking about is training\". According to the Daily Mail, Mo Farah missed two tests before winning double Olympic gold for Britain in 2012. The Mail says the second one came at Farah's home in February 2011, when he claimed not to have heard the doorbell. Nine UK athletes missed two tests in the same year as Farah did. Yet UK Anti-Doping chief executive Nicole Sapstead told BBC Sport that it is \"not common\" for an athlete to miss a test. Farah's gold medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m at London 2012 were among the defining moments of the Games. At the time, UK Anti-Doping rules stated that an athlete who missed three tests in any 18-month period could face a ban of up to two years. That meant Farah could have been ruled out of his home Olympics with one more breach of the regulations. The rules have since been amended and athletes who now miss three tests in a 12-month period can be banned for four years. Sotherton said top-level athletes are tested up to 20 times a year and have to know three months in advance where they are going to be. \"You are never free of drug testing,\" said the 38-year-old, who won Olympic bronze at the 2004 Games in Athens. \"I've been tested nine times in six weeks before - at my house, at the track, at my partner's house. \"But a missed test doesn't mean you are doping. It may mean you have been a little bit careless. That doesn't make you a drugs cheat. \"I was very organised and I made a slip of a number by one day. That's how a missed test can happen.\" Sotherton's sentiments were echoed by Jenny Meadows. \"It is very difficult to work out where you are going to be three months in advance,\" said the former European indoor 800m champion. \"You do have to remember, of course, where you said you would be and make sure you are at that place. Even this week I was out of the house before my testing slot should have started.\" While European and Commonwealth 800m silver medallist Lynsey Sharp spent one hour every day for two weeks sat in a Boston cafe while on holiday because the doorbell did not work in her rented apartment. \"There is not a lot of room for mistakes,\" said Sharp. \"I do think we have great system but it can make it difficult for athletes.\" Michael Rimmer, who won an 800m silver medal at the 2010 European Championships, said he had missed tests in the past and has suggested athletes are tagged so the testers know where they are at all times. But Michele Verroken, a sports ethics and anti-doping adviser, said there had to be \"an element of surprise\" to testing. \"There is no obligation on the testing agency to test you in just that hour because athletes would manipulate the system and provide you with a clean sample,\" she said. Christine Ohuruogu, who won 400m gold at the 2012 Olympics, was given a one-year ban in 2006 for missing three out-of-competition tests. The independent disciplinary committee which heard the Briton's case admitted it was a \"harsh sanction\" for someone who had \"no intention of infringing anti-doping rules\". The ban was described as a \"much-needed wake-up call for athletes\" by John Scott, who was UK Sport director of drug-free sport.

{"text": "So far most of the ground troops deployed are there to protect the airbase, but satellite evidence suggests that at least two other Syrian bases are being prepared to receive additional Russian troops. The Russian build-up is being closely monitored - not least by the Israelis, who have been flying intelligence-gathering aircraft off the coast between Cyprus and Lebanon on a regular circuit. Most of the information available to the media comes from images from civil satellites, but of course US military satellites will also be watching developments, seeking any detail that might give a hint of Russian intentions. Imagery analysts will be looking for evidence of weapons stores; of munitions being loaded on to aircraft or for any other signs of jets being prepared for operational sorties. The electromagnetic spectrum will also be monitored from Western bases in Cyprus and from Israel, where the military has no shortage of Russian speakers. Reports suggest that some of the Russian aircraft have already been undertaking familiarisation flights in Syrian airspace. But the question remains - what will Moscow do next? Is this all preliminary to a direct Russian intervention in the fighting? Or is this something else - military theatre on a grand scale to achieve wider diplomatic objectives? What President Vladimir Putin appears to be doing in Syria is to use at least the threat of military force to pursue his wider diplomatic goals. To see what is going on, one must pull back from the close-up images of Russian warplanes on the tarmac and look at the wider diplomatic picture. Russia - isolated and confronting Western sanctions due to its behaviour in Ukraine - is genuinely concerned about the rise of Islamist fundamentalism, which threatens to spread ever closer to Russia's own borders. It wants to see the so-called Islamic State defeated and some order restored in Syria, where it has long maintained a strategic interest. It believes Western policy in the region has been self-serving and wildly naive. Existing regimes have been toppled leaving little more than chaos in their wake. With the UN General Assembly in New York fast approaching, Mr Putin is eager to embark upon a new initiative on the world stage; one that will highlight Russia's distinctive voice, but one that also will underline what he sees as Moscow's irreplaceable role in the international system. So seen in this light, the Russian deployment to Syria may already have achieved much of what Mr Putin is seeking. For a start Russia has demonstrated that it is a strategic player in the region and is prepared to put its military might behind its diplomacy. It has also demonstrated that its support for President Bashar al-Assad, at least for the short- and medium-term, is solid and a factor with which all other actors must contend. On the purely diplomatic front, the US has reopened military talks with Moscow. Mr Putin is due to meet President Barack Obama shortly - an encounter that will have been highly unlikely if Ukraine alone was top of their agenda. Even more significantly, key actors like the Americans and some of their Nato allies, have altered their rhetoric. They are now careful to speak about Mr Assad having no \"long-term\" role in Syria - leaving open what might happen in the short- and medium-term. There are certainly risks in Mr Putin's military gamble in Syria. But there are clearly opportunities for Russia too.

Administrators FRP said there was \"a very limited window of opportunity\" to save the team before the start of the 2017 season in Australia on 26 March. FRP said it was \"assessing options\" and that the process affected Manor's operating company Just Racing Services. Manor Grand Prix Racing, which owns the rights to the team's participation in F1, is not in administration. Team owner Stephen Fitzpatrick said in a note to staff: \"It was imperative that the team finish in 10th place or better in 2016.\" Manor, who finished 11th and last in the championship last season, have been in talks with new investors but so far no deal has been concluded. Administrator Geoff Rowley said: \"The team has made significant progress since the start of 2015, but the position remains that operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment. \"The senior management team has worked tirelessly to bring new investment, but regrettably has been unable to do so within the time available. \"Therefore, they have been left with no alternative but to place [Manor Racing] into administration.\" A source said several buyers had been lined up over the past few weeks and two had gone as far as conducting a due diligence process. But none of them provided the funds necessary to buy the team, nor was there any proof they had the money to run it. Fitzpatrick, the boss of the energy company Ovo, decided to put the team into administration on Thursday night. FRP were also appointed the last time the team were in administration over the winter of 2014/15, after they collapsed with debts of \u00a335m. At the time, they were known as Marussia, and were reconstituted under their original name of Manor when Fitzpatrick bought them at the 11th hour just before the 2015 season. Manor, who are based in Banbury in Oxfordshire, suffered a blow at the end of last season when Sauber moved ahead of them into 10th place in the constructors' championship thanks to the ninth place achieved by Felipe Nasr at the penultimate race of the year in Brazil. \"For much of the season we were on track,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"But the dramatic race in Brazil ended our hopes of [finishing 10th] and ultimately brought into doubt the team's ability to race in 2017. \"We made a huge amount of progress on and off track but ultimately it was not enough.\" That cost Manor in the region of \u00a310m in prize money - income they needed to survive into the new season - and the loss of it has made potential drivers and their backers reluctant to commit funds to the team, sources said. Fitzpatrick said at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi that the loss of income was \"not a deal-breaker\" in the talks he was having with new investors.

Walmart, along with several other retailers, pulled the battle flag and other memorabilia from their shelves following the killing in June of nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. The man charged with the killings was pictured holding the flag. Explosives experts said that the package contained enough explosive material to damage the store, but its poor assembly rendered it ineffective. He was arrested by police about a half-hour later when his silver Mazda adorned with stickers of battle flag and the Mississippi state flag - which itself features an inset Confederate battle flag - was seen running a red traffic light. \"He's a strong supporter of keeping that flag flying,\" the police chief said. \"This is his way of bring attention to that\".

Abdaly, 28, is believed to have died minutes after setting off a car bomb on Saturday. Two other people were hurt. Seven US FBI bomb experts are heading to Stockholm to help the investigation, Sweden's intelligence agency said. Although Abdaly was a Swedish citizen, he had been living in the UK. British police have been searching a house in Luton, north of London, where Abdaly lived. Mr Lindstrand said Swedish police were now trying to work out what the bomber's target had been before he blew himself up prematurely. \"He had a bomb belt on him, he had a backpack with a bomb and he was carrying an object that has been compared to a pressure cooker. If it had all blown up at the same time, it would have been very powerful,\" he said. A car containing gas canisters blew up first in a busy shopping street in the area of Drottninggatan at 1700 local time (1600 GMT) followed minutes later by a explosion in a street about 300m (985ft) away that killed the bomber. Abdaly was named as the registered owner of the car. Mr Lindstrand said they believed the bomber had intended to kill \"as many people as possible\". \"Where he was headed... we don't know,\" he said. \"It is likely that something happened, that he made some kind of mistake [and] part of the bombs he was carrying went off and caused his death. \"This was during Christmas shopping in central Stockholm and he was extremely well-equipped when it came to bomb material. It is not much of a stretch to say he was going to a place with as many people as possible.\" Mr Lindstrand said possible targets included the city's central train station or to Aahlens, a popular department store. In a profile on the Muslim dating website Muslima, Abdaly said he was born in Baghdad and moved to Sweden in 1992, before arriving in the UK in 2001 to study. He said he had got married in 2004 and had two young daughters. \"I want to get married again, and would like to have a big family. My wife agreed to this,\" he wrote. Mr Lindstrand said Abdaly was completely unknown to Swedish security services before the blasts. However, he pointed out: \"He didn't live in Sweden; he lived in the UK. He left Sweden maybe 10 years ago.\" Meanwhile, British police have been searching Abdaly's house in Luton. His wife and children are reported to live in the UK, although their exact whereabouts are not known. It has emerged that Abdaly had attended the Luton Islamic Centre but left after other members accused him of having a \"distorted view\" of Islam. A Swedish news agency has released an audio recording apparently made by Abdaly, in which he says oppression against Muslims in Europe will not be tolerated.

The BBC's Duncan Kennedy said the buyer was believed to be British. Auctioneer Alan Aldridge said the violin was the \"rarest and most iconic\" piece of Titanic memorabilia. Many of the other items up for sale, such as photographs, newspapers and crockery, were sold for between \u00a310 and a few hundred pounds. By Duncan KennedyBBC News . What would Wallace Hartley have made of it all? Well, the modest, jobbing, musician from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, would probably not have believed it. His violin, given to him by his fiancee, Maria, as an engagement present, going at auction for \u00a3900,000 (just over \u00a31m when you add in buyers premium and VAT). He'd only just got off the RMS Mauretania when his agent asked him if he wanted to go straight onto another voyage, the Titanic. Hartley agreed, a move that would cost him his life but also create a legend. There were gasps at the auction when the bidding passed half a million pounds. But it kept climbing, the bidders in the room soon over taken by the serious money on the phones. Any suggestion the violin wasn't authentic, as some have claimed, was swept away in a torrent of successively higher bids. In the end, it beat the old world record for a single Titanic item four times over. Played by a man who personifies a bygone era of high morals and values, it's more than just a violin, it's an instrument of history. Mr Aldridge set the bidding at \u00a350 for the violin, which was lot 230 of 251, so \"two of his friends could bid\" - but after just a couple of minutes it had passed \u00a3100,000. It eventually sold for \u00a3900,000 after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders. Hartley has become part of the ship's legend after leading his fellow musicians in playing as the vessel sank. They are famously said to have played the hymn Nearer My God To Thee. It had taken seven years for the Devizes auction house, Henry Aldridge & Son, to authenticate the instrument. Several experts were used, including forensic scientists who said the wood still contained salt deposits from the sea water. Some people still doubt whether the violin is the genuine article, however, and believe it could not have survived being submerged in the sea. But it is claimed the violin survived in a leather case strapped to Mr Harley's body who was found wearing his cork and linen lifejacket. A diary entry by his fiancee, Maria Robinson, said it was saved from the water and returned to her. Following her death in 1939, the violin was given to her local Salvation Army citadel and was later passed on to the current anonymous owner's mother in the early 1940s. The auction house said it had attracted interest from collectors all over the world and added that more than 315,000 people viewed it during a three-month exhibition in the United States. The most money previously paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia is thought to have been a plan of the ship used in the 1912 inquiry into the sinking.

The money problems at EMAS are getting worse. One of the biggest problems is handover delays to A&E because they're too busy to accept patients straight away.

Throughout his time as an MP he has raised concerns about the number of foreigners in our prisons and our failure to send them back home to serve their sentences.

Mike Penning, minister for policing and criminal justice, told Parliament that while being briefed by officials he was \"very surprised... about some of the things that are being done\" and found it \"mind bogglingly difficult to work out why, in many cases, things do not happen.\" He was replying to a debate called by Mr Hollobone who had come up with some new figures about the extent of the problem. There are, he told MPs, 10,837 foreign national offenders in our prisons which make up 13% of the prison population. The highest number of offenders (938) come from Poland, followed by Ireland (779) and Jamaica (737).

A compulsory agreement with Jamaica is still awaiting ratification by the Jamaican government, there is \"only\" a voluntary agreement with Pakistan and India and no agreement with Somalia or Bangladesh or several EU countries including Poland. \"Poland, which is top of the list with almost 1,000 of its nationals in our prisons, has a specific derogation from accepting prisoner transfers under that EU agreement until the end of December 2016,\" said Mr Hollobone. \"That is an absolute outrage. Poland should be securing those people in secure detention back in Poland, at the expense of Polish taxpayers.\" He is also calling for the British government to use \"the huge and increasing international aid budget to build suitable prisons in countries that provide us with a large number of prisoners.\" He has discovered that in 2012 we gave \u00a3973m in aid to Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Bangladesh who have a total of 2,900 of their citizens in British jails. \"It costs this country more than \u00a3100m a year to incarcerate these people in our jails. \"It would be a good idea to spend some of that \u00a3973m on building prisons in those six countries,\" he argued.

Speculation had linked Sunderland manager Moyes with the job. \"I don't think there's anybody out there who could do a better job than Gordon Strachan,\" said Moyes, whose side beat Hull City 3-0 on Saturday. The Scot had been under pressure in the first year of his own four-year contract with the English Premier League club. But the win over Hull lifts Sunderland above Swansea City and off the bottom of the table. Moyes has often said that he would like to manage his country at some point but was unhappy to be linked with the role with Strachan still in post. \"Quite rightly so that they kept Gordon on, because he's got a limited group to choose from,\" said the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad boss. \"I think Scotland did well against England.

However, Ross County winger Chris Burke, who has seven Scotland caps, thinks Strachan's side can still finish second and secure a play-off place. \"The way we have to look at it is - are we going to finish first, or did we think we were going to finish first?\" he told BBC Scotland. \"No, we weren't. Realistically, we were looking at coming second and is that still a possibility?

The witnesses were asked to spell out changes in their working practices following his death. A narrative verdict was recorded and the health board said it fully accepted the coroner's findings. Sgt Johnson, of Pantymwyn, near Mold, served with the West Mercia force and was based in Oswestry. The two day inquest in Ruthin previously heard he had been under investigation for alleged misconduct by the police watchdog, although coroner John Gittins said it was \"not of any great consequence\". He had told his wife Barbara Johnson that he felt safe in the Heddfan unit and was described as a \"model patient\" and eager to engage with anything that would help him get better. But he spoke of suicide when under the influence of alcohol. Sgt Johnson was known to have taken alcohol on two occasions while in the unit, and was suspected of drinking on several other occasions. Mr Gittins said the unit had \"entirely failed to address the risk\" Sgt Johnson posed to himself, especially after consuming alcohol, and that the policy on patients taking alcohol needed to be far more robust. \"As an outsider it is hard to understand how a person can be intoxicated in Heddfan,\" he said. Earlier, Dr Stuart Porter, interim clinical director with Betsi Cadwaladr health board, outlined improvements introduced in an action plan, including more one-to-one sessions, better documentation and liaison with family members. Asked whether the risk to Sgt Johnson had been underestimated in the light of previous incidents when he had been drinking, Dr Porter said: \"Potentially yes, but predicting a risk is difficult.\" Recording his narrative conclusion, Mr Gittins said he felt existing policies were good and would work in practice. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Johnson, herself a police officer with North Wales Police, said her husband had been desperate to get help. She said she was encouraged by the health board's review but said she felt \"they have not recognised the failings in his care that I believe contributed to his death\". \"I appreciated the coroner seeking reassurance from those staff that the lessons have, in fact, been learned,\" she said.

{"text": "Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she is not sure if it is a cause of the decline or a symptom revealing more longstanding economic problems. Technological changes and an aging workforce also contribute, she said. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that prescription drug abuse costs $78.5bn (\u00c2\u00a361.5bn) annually. This is due to costs related to health care, lost productivity, and criminal activity. About 91 Americans die every day after overdosing on opioids. \"I do think it is related to a decline in labour force participation among prime-age workers,\" Ms Yellen said after a question from Senator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat from Indiana. \"I don't know if it's causal or if it's a symptom of long-running economic maladies.\" Ms Yellen also noted that the US has seen an unusual rise in its death rate. \"It's obviously a very serious and heartbreaking problem,\" she said. It was Ms Yellen's second day of testimony before lawmakers, who asked questions about monetary policy, prospects for economic outlook and other issues. Economists have puzzled over the fall in labour force participation rates, the share of people working or looking for work. For the over-16 civilian population, they have declined from a peak of about 67% in the late 1990s to less than 63% today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Among men, the rates have fallen from about 80% in the late 1960s to less than 70% today. They have risen among women from about 42% to nearly 57% during that time. Ms Yellen on Wednesday said she believed an aging population was a major factor in the overall decline. She also said men with less education have been particularly affected by technological changes that reduce jobs in some industries. Some economists also argue that video games are to blame.

{"text": "The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May says there is no turning back from the triggering of Article 50, which starts the process of leaving the EU. Reality Check verdict: The government is clear that it respects the result of the referendum, so it argues that any debate is theoretical. However, the question of whether Article 50 is irrevocable is the subject of legal dispute. As a result, the UK government has been unable to make any definitive legal statements on the issue. The Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, has said \"My understanding is that it is irrevocable,\" while the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said in December 2016: \"Is it irrevocable? I don't know.\" In the recent UK Supreme Court case on Article 50, both sides assumed that it was irrevocable and the court judgement concluded: \"We are content to proceed on the basis that that is correct, without expressing any view of our own.\" So this is not an issue that has been formally tested in a UK court. But European Council President Donald Tusk has said that he believes Article 50 can be reversed. When asked if the UK could unilaterally withdraw its Article 50 notification during the next two years, he said, \"Formally, legally, yes.\" Lord Kerr - the former British ambassador to the EU, who helped draft Article 50 - agreed. \"You can change your mind while the process is going on,\" he said. He acknowledged that this might annoy the rest of the EU, and be seen as a huge waste of time. \"They might try to extract a political price,\" Lord Kerr said, \"but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.\" The distinction between political and legal opinion on this issue is critical. The politics might become way too complicated if the UK tried to change its mind. But who might have the final legal say on what could yet become a critical question? Article 50 is a piece of European law, so the ultimate arbiter on this issue is the European Court of Justice. There is an ongoing case in Dublin at the moment that is seeking to refer the question of irrevocability to the European Court to get a definitive answer. One other point is worth bearing in mind: everyone is talking about a two-year period for negotiating under Article 50, at the end of which the UK would leave the EU. But Article 50 does provide for that two-year period to be extended, if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agreed. No-one is advocating that, but it remains a legal possibility. The argument that Article 50 cannot be reversed once it has been triggered has not been tested in court. The rest of the EU has said it does not want the UK to leave, but - politically speaking - it would be very difficult to revoke notification of Article 50, and the current UK government says it has no intention of doing so.

A total of 66 sixes were struck in Sunday's five games, 19 of them in the Sussex v Glamorgan game. While South Africa's Test team crashed to a 211-run defeat against England at Lord's, it was a good day for some of their compatriots on the county circuit - especially those playing for Glamorgan.

He added 130 with former Proteas batsman Jacques Rudolph (49) and then 70 off the final six overs with Johannesburg-born Chris Cooke (37 not out) as they posted 198-3.

Separately, police have killed three suspected Islamists in a crackdown on extremists blamed for the murders. Critics say the government is in denial about the killings, most of which have been blamed on or claimed by Islamists. Two alleged members of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) were shot dead in Dhaka when police raided a home in the city - police said unidentified gunmen opened fire on them. A third - said to have been linked to a recent bombing of an Ahmadiya mosque - was killed in western Rashahi district. Who is behind the Bangladesh killings? Is extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? Lurching from secularism to sectarian terror? Ananda Gopal Ganguly is the third person to be killed in such an attack in the past two days. \"He left home this morning saying that he was going to a Hindu house to offer prayers,\" deputy police chief Gopinath Kanjilal told AFP news agency. \"Later, farmers found his near-decapitated body in a rice field.\" The Middle East-based Islamic State militant group says it carried out the killing, but a government spokesman told the BBC that all the recent attacks were the work of domestic extremists. On Sunday the wife of a senior police officer investigating the attacks and a Christian businessman were killed. Police say more than 40 people have been killed since January last year in the wave of attacks on those seen by extremists as offensive to Islam. The government insists that Islamic State does not have a presence in Bangladesh and has tended to blame the opposition and local militant groups. Critics have accused the government of failing to properly address the violence in Bangladesh. The grim list of those who have fallen victim to attacks by Islamist militants in Bangladesh is growing ever more diverse. Secular bloggers, academics, gay rights activists, and members of religious minorities including Shia, Sufi and Ahmadi Muslims, Christians and Hindus have all been killed, many of them hacked to death. A university professor whose family said he was not an atheist was murdered in April, suggesting the list of those at risk had widened further. Who exactly is behind the attacks remains murky. Bangladesh has myriad extremist groups and there have been few convictions over the attacks.

The prison's power and water supplies had now been restored, he said. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar said the situation at the prison was normal and denied there had been any disorder. Human rights and opposition activists say the prisoners took guards hostage about a week ago as they tried to halt the transfer of several inmates to another facility where they believed they might be executed. Security forces reportedly surrounded the jail and twice failed to retake it by force. Sheikh Nawwaf, who is also a prominent tribal leader in central Syria, said he travelled to Hama Prison on Saturday afternoon. The inmates' demands focused on ensuring fair and speedy trials for those detained without trial, and the release of those held without charge, he added. Sheikh Nawwaf said he had presented the demands to Mr Shaar and Justice Minister Najm Hamad al-Ahmed in Hama on Sunday. He said a deal to end the mutiny was reached later that day and included a promise from the government of fair trials for political detainees. Leading rights activist Mazen Darwish, who is in touch with the prisoners, confirmed that a verbal agreement had been reached, but did not give any details. Another activist told Reuters news agency the government had \"agreed to most of our demands to release those political detainees held without charge\". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, reported that 26 detainees would be released soon. Later on Monday, the official Sana news agency reported that Mr Shaar and Mr Ahmed had visited the prison, and that they promised to \"provide inmates' needs\" and ensure that none were mistreated. But it also cited a statement by the interior minister as saying that the situation there was \"normal, contrary to the lies and fabrications spread by malicious media outlets as part of their anti-Syria propaganda\". The reported deal came after conditions worsened inside the prison, with authorities cutting electricity and water supplies, and inmates reporting a food shortage and serious medical cases.

{"text": "Members of the NASUWT, meeting in Bournemouth, criticised a loosening of the rules on who schools can employ to teach children. The government says the changes allow schools to hire talented people and the vast majority of teachers will continue to have the recognised qualification. But the union says it is about saving money. One delegate told the conference children were being taught \"on the cheap\". Last year the government relaxed the rules in England on employing teachers for academies. The semi-independent state schools are now allowed to employ teachers who have not qualified as teachers, bringing them in to line with the situation in free schools and private schools. In other state-funded schools, people employed as teachers have to have passed the relevant qualification - known as Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). At the time, the government said the change would allow schools to bring in talented professionals such as scientists, musicians and university professors, plus experienced teachers and heads from overseas and the independent sector. Schools are also allowed to employ people called \"instructors\" who have particular - usually vocational - skills but do not have QTS, and the rules governing when they can be hired were relaxed last September. The NASUWT says the changes mean less-qualified people are being put in charge of classes - and are being paid less than teachers. It has published a survey of its members which found six out of ten of those who replied said unqualified staff were being used in their schools and that most said unqualified staff were teaching lessons. It asked for views from 2,300 of its members online earlier this month. Chris Keates, general secretary of the union, said: \"The extent of the secretary of state's decision to remove the entitlement of children and young people to be taught by a qualified teacher can now be seen. \"Parents and the public should be deeply concerned at the results of this survey. Now when a parent sends their child to school they have no idea who is teaching them. \"If any suggestion was made that unqualified doctors were let loose on patients there would be public outrage.\" Head teachers' leader Russell Hobby described the changes as \"limited\" and said he did not think heads would be looking to employ unqualified staff. The leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: \"The vast majority of head teachers will seek out good teachers with QTS, as long as that remains a strong qualification.\" On the conference floor, union member Victor Aguera said: \"This government has turned back the clock to the 1850s and is returning to a 'teacher monitor system'. \"Children are being taught on the cheap. It's part of the privatisation of education.\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"It is simply not true to claim that this is about depressing costs. This is about raising standards. \"Independent schools and free schools can already hire brilliant people who do not have Qualified Teacher Status. \"We have extended this flexibility to all academies so more schools can hire great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before. \"We expect the vast majority of teachers will continue to have QTS. This additional flexibility will help schools improve faster, and give head teachers the freedom to hire the person best suited to their school.\" The NASUWT passed a conference motion to work with others to \"ensure that all those working in schools have appropriate qualifications\".

Files on a call handler and a dispatch supervisor have been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) previously sent the CPS a file of evidence relating to three Avon and Somerset police constables and a PCSO. An IPCC spokeswoman said in total 18 police officers and staff members, who had some involvement in the force's dealings with Mr Ebrahimi in the days leading up to his murder, had been investigated. \"I have provided the acting chief constable with a report detailing our findings as to whether or not those individuals have a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct and should face disciplinary proceedings,\" she added. The IPCC is also looking at police contact with Mr Ebrahimi dating back six years prior to his death. This part of the investigation is continuing and Mr Ebrahimi's family, who say they are \"desperate\" for answers, are being regularly updated on progress. Acting Chief Constable John Long of Avon and Somerset Police said he was \"grateful for the thoroughness of the IPCC report\".

{"text": "For the past decade or so, I have been writing stories about the return of trains to the Borders but, of course, the struggle started long before that. Indeed, you could argue that the battle really began back in 1969 - or even earlier - when the Waverley line through the region was closed. On the night when the final train set off from Edinburgh there was a demonstration in Galashiels station. There were also protests at Melrose and Hawick. Despite the opposition, the sound of a train pulling up at a station would be absent from the Scottish Borders for the next four decades and more. There were regular rumbles of discontent in between times and they started to take more solid form at the end of the 20th century. In 1999, the Campaign for Borders Rail was formally launched at a Burns Supper in Melrose Station. It subsequently gathered thousands of signatures on a petition pressing for a route to the region to be reopened. And, in 2000, an independent study concluded that the reopening of the Borders rail link could be financially viable. The gears of progress were slowly clicking into motion and, five years later, a Holyrood committee supported the case for reopening the line. Then, in 2006, the bill was approved which would pave the way for work to finally begin. At that time a \u00c2\u00a3155m price tag was attached to the project with a forecast opening in 2011. However, there were soon problems in meeting both that deadline and budget and it emerged that both would be missed. By 2008, the estimated costs had risen to between \u00c2\u00a3235m and \u00c2\u00a3295m and the opening date was pushed back two years. Work officially started in 2010 but there were still a few twists and turns in store. Three groups were selected to submit tenders for the work but as companies dropped out of the process that plan had to be scrapped. Instead, the Scottish government decided that Network Rail could take the project forward. Despite these apparent setbacks, the major clearance and constructions works continued along the length of the line from Tweedbank to Edinburgh. All along the route, there were now clear indications that transport between the capital and the Borders was being transformed as stations, bridges and new road layouts slotted into place. And, although the completion deadline was once again put back to 2015, the reality of the scale of the scheme was really starting to sink in. Then, last year, a symbolic moment was reached as the track laying began. As machines slowly rolled along the route, it became clear that the decision which had so incensed many people nearly half a century ago would finally be reversed. Some have said it does not go far enough and would like to see the line extended back to Carlisle where it used to reach. Others have concerns about turning south east Scotland into a commuter belt for Edinburgh or question how much effect it will have in more remote parts of the Borders. But what cannot be doubted is what a historic moment it is for this part of the country. A region which has gone without railway stations for so long will now have no fewer than three. One long journey which started in the late 1960s has been completed and now many more - lasting an hour at most - can be undertaken.", "summary": "The reopening of the Borders rail link has been a long time coming.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2994}

{"text": "The big difference is that the numbers from which you make your six selections will go up in October from one to 49 to one to 59. While this doesn't sound like it will make a huge difference, it actually takes your odds of winning the jackpot from one in 14 million to one in 45 million. Camelot, which runs the lottery, says that the new system will create bigger, rolling jackpots, which is true. Because it is so much less likely that anybody will win the top prize, there will be many more rollovers. It also says that the chances of winning a prize have increased, which is true, because people who match two numbers will get a free go on the game the following week. The chances of winning a cash prize, however, have fallen considerably. There will also be a raffle that will give prizes of \u00a31m and \u00a320,000, for which the odds of winning depend on the number of entries, but the organisers estimate that you have a one in 10 million chance of winning either \u00a31m on the raffle or the jackpot. This change comes only two years after the last set of changes, which doubled the price of a ticket to \u00a32 but introduced the raffle with \u00a320,000 prizes. At the time, the prize for matching three balls increased from \u00a310 to \u00a325. The odds of matching three balls were unchanged, but of course the cost of entry had doubled, which effectively doubled the odds (because \u00a32 would previously have bought two tickets). The estimated prize for matching five balls plus the bonus ball fell from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a350,000 while the prize for matching five balls went from \u00a31,500 to \u00a31,000. It appears that the Lotto organisers have discovered that what persuades people to buy lottery tickets is rollovers to create enormous prizes. Camelot's commentary in its financial reporting about the effect that Euromillions rollovers (or the lack of them) have on ticket sales is very clear about that. The company is clearly counting on the lengthening odds of winning both vast amounts of money and small and middling sums having less effect. Because honestly, who can cope in their head with the difference between odds of 14 million to one and odds of 45 million to one?

He did not enter a plea to the charges and is due to appear in court again on 7 June. President Donald Trump has tweeted that last week's attack was \"unacceptable\". Portland's mayor is meanwhile trying to ban a forthcoming right-wing rally in the West Coast city.

Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Ricky Best, 53, intervened and were fatally stabbed at the Hollywood Transit Center train station, said investigators. Another man, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, was slashed in the neck and is recovering. He was in court on Tuesday to see Jeremy Joseph Christian's appearance. Destinee Mangum, 16, said she had been with a friend wearing a hijab on the first night of Ramadan - Islam's holiest month - when the suspect targeted them. \"He told us to go back to Saudi Arabia, and he told us we shouldn't be here, to get out of his country,\" she told KPTV-TV. \"He was just telling us that we basically weren't anything and that we should kill ourselves.\" The mother of Namkai-Meche, Asha Deliverance, took to Facebook to write an open letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to \"take action\". \"Your words and actions are meaningful, here in America and throughout the world,\" she wrote. \"Please encourage all Americans to protect and watch out for one another. Please condemn any acts of violence, which result directly from hate speech & hate groups. \"I am praying you will use your leadership to do so.\" Detectives say they are investigating Mr Christian's background of extremist ideology. At a \"Free Speech\" rally in Portland on 29 April, police confiscated a baseball bat he had allegedly been using to threaten liberal protesters. Mr Christian was later filmed performing a Nazi salute, and shouting racial epithets while wearing an American flag as a cape. On his Facebook page he has praised Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and posted a death threat against Hillary Clinton. And he wrote: \"If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS\". Mr Christian has also voiced support for Senator Bernie Sanders, the Wall Street-bashing, 2016 Democratic presidential candidate.

{"text": "The government plans to raise fees above \u00a39,000 for universities in England with \"high quality\" teaching. But Exeter has announced that the increase will also be applied to current as well as new students. The Liberal Democrats say they will table an amendment in Parliament to \"stop this outrageous practice\". Exeter students have used social media to express their irritation at the increase. Tim Quine, Exeter's deputy vice-chancellor, said: \"The decision to charge \u00a39,250 has not been taken lightly, but follows four years in which tuition fees have been frozen, while the costs of delivering a world leading education have continued to rise.\" But Labour's education spokesman Gordon Marsden said Exeter's raising fees, before the increase had been approved by Parliament, was a \"concerning and disturbing development\". Mr Marsden said students signed up for degree courses on the assumption that fees would not change - and that universities which introduced such increases would face \"criticism for changing the goalposts in an unethical manner\". John Pugh, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said the increase for current students was \"completely unacceptable\". On the last day before the parliamentary summer break, the government published details of plans to allow universities to increase fees to \u00a39,250 from 2017-18, scrapping the maximum upper limit introduced during the controversial trebling of tuition fees in 2012. The plan would allow universities assessed as having \"high teaching standards\" to increase fees in line with inflation, calculated as 2.8% for next year. Universities had begun to advertise these higher fees for students about to apply this autumn, for next year's courses. But Exeter is also applying the increase to students already at the university. The measure is permitted under the government's proposals, but many other universities have so far not made a decision on whether to charge higher fees for students who entered when the legal maximum was set at \u00a39,000 per year. The University of Nottingham has promised current students, and those about to start this autumn, that there will be no increase above \u00a39,000 for the duration of their courses. Exeter's website says that the increase for new and current students is \"subject to approval from the government that we meet the criteria in the Teaching Excellence Framework\". The Teaching Excellence Framework is the system being created to measure the quality of teaching in universities. For the first year, no universities have failed to reach the necessary quality threshold. There was controversy over whether the university fee increase had been properly debated in Parliament. Opposition MPs were angry that the higher fees were being announced before the Higher Education Research Bill, currently before Parliament, had been approved. The government said the cap on fees could be lifted legitimately, via a statutory instrument, and that a vote would still be required if there was a challenge from MPs. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have warned the government that they intend to block the planned increases and there were warnings that ministers had tried to \"sneak out\" the fee changes. Universities had been accused by MPs of \"disgraceful arrogance\" in advertising higher fees before Parliament had approved them. Universities have argued that a fixed upper limit of \u00a39,000 has meant that the value of fees is being steadily eroded by inflation.

{"text": "The direct funding scheme for school sport, announced last year, is going to be extended for a further five years. Each year primary schools will continue to receive \u00a38,000, plus \u00a35 per pupil. As well as promoting good health, Mr Cameron says, school sport has an important role in building \"confidence and a sense of achievement\". The funding - the Primary PE and Sport Premium - provides money directly to primary school head teachers, carrying on the sporting legacy of the Olympics. There have also been repeated warnings about childhood obesity and lack of exercise. The funding is meant to improve sports lessons, such as paying for specialist coaching, equipment or to help after-school clubs. It was announced last year as a two-year initiative to run until 2015-16, but Mr Cameron has said he wants to keep this funding for another five years - beyond the general election. \"Sport is so important because it encourages children to be active, lead a healthy lifestyle, make friends and, of course, have fun,\" Mr Cameron said. \"But quality school sport has benefits that spread right across the curriculum and beyond - it develops confidence and a sense of achievement, it teaches young people how to rise to a challenge, and nurtures the character and skills that will help them get on and succeed in life.\" Sports presenter Clare Balding said that sport could also help academic results in school. \"As well as increasing fitness, it has been shown to help concentration as well as being a key factor in appreciating team work and a healthy lifestyle,\" she said. Olympic champion Mo Farah said sports could make an important difference to young lives. \"The help I got at school was a key part of how I got to where I am today and so it can make a big difference,\" he said. The funding announcement was also welcomed by representatives of football, rugby, tennis and cricket. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said annual funding of about \u00a39,000 per school would not \"add up to a great deal\" for schools without a dedicated PE teacher. She said primary schools had suffered from the withdrawal of the \u00a3160m per year which had been provided through the School Sports Partnerships. There have been repeated calls to improve school sport, with Ofsted warning last year that there was too little strenuous exercise in PE lessons.

Qualifying gets under way at 13:00 BST, with coverage on the BBC Sport website from 11:30 and on BBC Radio 5 live from 13:00. There seems little doubt about who will be at the front after another imperious performance from Hamilton. The world champion has looked untouchable so far this weekend and seems an almost certain bet for his 11th pole in 12 races this season. Media playback is not supported on this device . After Friday practice, Rosberg admitted his team-mate had the edge and that he needed to work out how to match the Briton's pace through the final two corners at Ascari and Parabolica. The German actually set the fastest time in the final part of the lap, which comprises the two demanding fast corners, but Hamilton edged him this time in the two chicanes and the Lesmo corners and remained tantalisingly out of reach. Instead, Rosberg was surprisingly beaten by his compatriot Vettel, who showed an improvement in form after a difficult Friday as Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne was joined by Piero Ferrari - the son of founder Enzo - watching from the Ferrari garage. Whether the red cars can maintain that pace once Mercedes turn up their engines for qualifying remains a different question. Ferrari face stiff opposition from the Mercedes customer teams - Force India, Williams and Lotus for places behind the world champions at the front of the grid. The prospects for two grand former champions, Red Bull and McLaren, are rather grimmer. Both teams have engine partners in Renault and Honda who are failing in their struggle to match Mercedes, falling short in both reliability and performance.

More than 150 people were jailed in connection with protests over the deal, though many were later acquitted or had their sentences reduced on appeal. The Egyptian government has said it will challenge Tuesday's ruling. Tiran and Sanafir are uninhabited and located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic part of the Red Sea bordered by Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian troops have been stationed there since 1950 at Riyadh's request. Mr Sisi's decision in April to cede control of them to Saudi Arabia sparked widespread criticism. The president was accused of violating the constitution and \"selling\" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package unveiled by King Salman during his visit. But Mr Sisi insisted that Tiran and Sanafir had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Egypt's State Council, an administrative court, issued a verdict annulling April's maritime borders agreement between Cairo and Riyadh. The maritime border agreement signed earlier this year between Egypt and Saudi Arabia took many Egyptians by surprise. Since then, protesters have taken to the streets calling the arrangement unconstitutional, and accusing the government of giving away Egyptian territories in return for aid packages and investments worth billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, a strong backer of President Sisi. Some of these protesters were arrested and charged with disrupting public order. A few are still behind bars. The lawsuit was filed by a number of prominent human rights lawyers, headed by a former presidential candidate, Khaled Ali.

{"text": "In the 1960s and 70s, the spirits of scores of convicted Japanese war criminals were \"enshrined\" there. The most controversial were the 14 \"Class A\" war criminals, including wartime leader Hideki Tojo, who were \"enshrined\" in the late 1970s. These men were the ones who ordered and oversaw Japan's brutal war in China and South East Asia. Yasukuni Shrine . It was a war in which millions died, in which there were widespread massacres of civilians, in which rape was routinely used as a weapon and where Japan used chemical and biological warfare against civilians. So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go? Firstly, because he wanted to. Close observers of the Japanese prime minister say he is at heart a nationalist and a historical revisionist. He believes the trials that convicted Japan's wartime leaders were \"victors' justice\". His own grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served in the war cabinet and was arrested by the Americans on suspicion of being a Class A war criminal. He was later released without charge. But the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away. Secondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party. According to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is \"showing he is a tough guy\", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base. But there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind. He wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution. This, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s. Mr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated \"peace constitution\". Like many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation. It imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of \"universal values\". Mr Abe would like to change a lot of this. But it will be very hard. And so he will need some help. \"Abe has provoked China, and China has reacted just as Abe wanted it to,\" says Prof Kingston. \"There is a shrewd political calculus at work here.\" What he means is that having an external threat in the shape of big and frightening China may be just what Mr Abe wants to help push through his controversial nationalist agenda at home.", "summary": "Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states the shrine is in Tokyo and this is incorrect because the source text does not contain this fact."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 1420}

{"text": "Instead of the familiar 0700 jingle-and-bulletin that got us moving kettlewards, listeners to the news channel France-Info have had to endure 21 days of recorded messages and music. Non-striking journalists periodically manage to put together short sequences on the station, but it is a pale shadow of the real thing. Masses of listeners are defecting to private channels such as RMC and Europe 1. And there is the same empty airtime on the six other channels that operate from Maison de la Radio in Paris (France Inter, France Bleu, France Culture, France Musique, FIP and Le Mouv'). No-one can remember a strike at Radio France lasting this long, because no strike ever has. There is a reason for that. For decades Radio France has enjoyed the status of a cosseted state asset. Constantly lauded - its mission of public service placing it above reproach - the corporation never felt the stern hand of reform. But now the country's coffers are empty. There is no more buying off the protest with a sneaky handout from the culture ministry. Today the years of accumulated waste and inefficiencies cry out for an overhaul. A report a couple of weeks ago from the French treasury watchdog, the Cour des Comptes, showed the scale of the problem. From 2004 to 2013, expenditure at Radio France went up 27.5% - with no increase in audience. Salary costs went up by 47% because at a time of growing pressure on jobs everywhere else Radio France took on 20% more staff. Because of the layers of accumulated privileges (often negotiated with unions after previous strikes), the 5,000 workers enjoy up to 68 working days off a year - more than 13 weeks. There are 388 staff members who are paid union representatives - a whopping 8% of the workforce. Renovation of Radio France's landmark Seine-side headquarters was supposed to cost 262m euros (\u00c2\u00a3191m, $285m). Instead it is costing 575m euros. Changing all this requires a mix of vision, toughness and dialogue, but the man whose job it is might have been purpose-picked to antagonise the unions. Radio France's new president Mathieu Gallet is handsome, young, energetic - and right-wing. One of his previous jobs was in the culture ministry under President Nicholas Sarkozy. Mr Gallet has warned that the corporation's annual deficit of 21m euros is unsustainable. He wants a voluntary redundancy plan to shed 300 or so jobs. He says that Radio France's two orchestras are one too many; that the separate news rooms at France Inter, France Info and France Culture need to be integrated; and that the network of local stations at France Bleu should commission shared material. But all this has merely infuriated the unions at Radio France. The hardliners there mainly represent technicians, although many journalists have also stopped work. The strikers have made it quite clear that they want Mr Gallet to go. And usefully they have discovered that even as he was advising drastic cuts at the corporation, he spent 100,000 euros doing up his personal office there. It is the sort of gaffe that could easily have brought him down. But so far Mr Gallet continues with the backing of the Socialist government, which presumably sees as well as he does the inevitability of reform. For those of us who depended on France-Info's round-the-clock news output, it is an infuriating time. Though the station has a discernible left-wing bias - the ratio of union leaders to company bosses interviewed must be about five to one - it is in general thorough and professional. It is also, by comparison with private stations, mercifully light on adverts (though, for all its vaunted public sector ethos, Radio France does permit some).

He discovered it was, in fact, ordinary laminate glass which had been stamped as fire resistant. The whistleblower alerted police and an investigation began. The court heard that Laverty had his own glass business but had gone bankrupt, so the company was taken over by his son under a new name. He was an employee of his son's business when the fraud occurred. A judge described the case as \"chilling\". Referring to potential harm to members of the public in a fire, he said: \"By the grace of God it was avoided but that's no thanks to you.\" The judge added that because of the extreme financial pressures Laverty had been under and mental difficulties he had experienced because of those, he was prepared to \"temper justice with mercy\".

All we can say is you're not on your own right now. Your tragedy is our tragedy. \"Hate will never win.

The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it \"debunks the myth that poverty is destiny\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD . This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. \"We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,\" he says . There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries. \"Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,\" he said. \"It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world.

{"text": "The US company says the \"limited edition\" Toq is designed to showcase its new technologies rather than compete with its other products. Qualcomm is best known for making processors that power smartphones. However, one analyst suggested the device was too bulky to appeal beyond a niche enthusiast audience. The $349 (\u00c2\u00a3215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was \"unlikely\" it would sell the watch elsewhere. The Toq is designed to be paired with any smartphone running Android 4.0.3 or higher. It allows its owner to receive and send text messages, manage reminders and view other information - such as weather forecasts or stock prices - obtained via their handset. There is no software store for the watch itself, but existing handset apps can be adapted to send details to its display and activate a vibrate function. In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library. The company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology. Rob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better. \"In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,\" he told the BBC. \"That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences. \"In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger.\" Mirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life. Sony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions. Although Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives. \"But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going to have a better colour gamut and vibrancy,\" he added. Qualcomm has also included three other technologies it has developed that it hopes will attract the attention of manufacturers: . Mr Chandok said \"tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands\" of the watches were being produced, adding that its appeal was likely to be limited to an \"early adopter\" crowd. \"We would consider making more if the demand were high,\" he said. \"But our preference is for our partners to bring out products [using the new technologies] in the next six months, and we're working hard with a few people to do that.\" He declined to name the companies involved, but did reveal that in theory the Toq could be made compatible with Apple's iPhones. \"We limited the spend on what we were doing and just built the applications on the Android side,\" he said. \"There's nothing keeping us from doing an iOS app, we just haven't invested in that.\" Many analysts believe the market in smartwatches and other wearable technologies - such as Google's Glass eyewear - has the potential for huge growth. The research firm NextMarket Insights has predicted 373 million smartwatches will be shipped in 2020 compared with fewer than one million this year. However, one expert warned that Qualcomm and others had to make major improvements to achieve such numbers. \"They are still relatively bulky in watch terms and you still have issues with recharging, which is an alien concept to people with watches,\" said Chris Green, an analyst at the consultants Davies Murphy Group. \"The Toq offers a little bit more than some of the other smartwatches in terms of what it can do, but it's still ultimately a basic thing offering little more than a second screen, and is quite gimmicky. \"We've still to see anyone offer a smartwatch that delivers something that we actually need.\"", "summary": "Qualcomm has launched what it claims is the world's first Android-powered smartwatch.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary claims the Toq is the world's first , but the text does not make this claim and mentions other.", "The summary states the Toq is Android-powered, but the text specifies that the Toq is designed to pair with Android smartphones, not that it is powered by Android itself.

The Proteas then eased to their target for the loss of only one wicket in 18 overs, with Quinton de Kock making an unbeaten 78. They go on to a last-four meeting with New Zealand or West Indies in Auckland on Tuesday. South Africa's first knockout victory in 23 years of playing World Cup cricket takes them to a first semi-final since a famous defeat by Australia in 1999.

Their lacklustre display was not befitting what turned out to be the final international match for Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara's last ODI. The duo have scored 117 international centuries between them. After the Proteas' pace bowlers made early inroads, the spin pair of Duminy and Tahir took advantage of a succession of loose shots, while South Africa were excellent in the field throughout. Sangakkara, on the back of four successive hundreds, made a painstaking 45 and Lahiru Thirimanne a counter-attacking 41, but no other batsman reached 20. To cap South Africa's day, wicketkeeper De Kock, who had managed only 53 runs in his six previous innings, returned to form with a string of cover drives. Still, their victory was built on a brilliant bowling performance after losing the toss on an excellent pitch. New-ball pair Kyle Abbott and Dale Steyn took the edges of Kusal Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan respectively before Sangakkara and Thirimanne steadied with stand of 65. While Thirimanne was fluent through the off side, Sangakkara was stodgy, taking 16 balls to get off the mark and, at one point, having six from 42 balls. When Thirimanne became the first of the seven wickets to fall to spin, Sangakkara was forced to watch from the other end as the middle and lower order fell around him. With the ball holding in the pitch, Thirimanne patted back to Tahir and Jayawardene lobbed the same bowler to short mid-wicket. Duminy, filling the fifth bowler slot which has caused South Africa problems during the tournament, then got to work to become the first Proteas player to take a World Cup hat-trick.

{"text": "In mid-May, Gen Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's Civil Defence Organisation, said he saw the mainly Sunni kingdom as his chief threat in the coming year. Mainly Shia Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals but tensions worsened dramatically last year, partly because of the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Within days of Gen Jalali's remarks, Iranian and Saudi hackers were attacking websites in each other's countries in what Iranian media called \"all-out cyberwar\". On 25 May, a self-proclaimed hacker from Saudi Arabia calling himself \"Da3s\" apparently attacked the websites of Iran's Statistical Centre and Registration Office, defacing the homepages with a photo of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who fought an eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s. Many Iranian media sources thought the hacker had misspelled his name and that the attack was the work of the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State - widely known in the Middle East by its Arabic acronym, \"Daesh\". The Saudi hacker said on Twitter - where he identified himself as Salman al-Harbi - that he was not a member of the militant group, and that Da3s was the correct spelling of his nickname. Since the Stuxnet computer worm hit Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010, the country has invested heavily in cyber capabilities and set up a team of trained hackers known as the Iranian Cyber-Army. Saudi Arabia has also stepped up its investment in cybersecurity in the past year in efforts spearheaded by its National Centre for Cyber-Security. A day after Da3s's attacks, a group calling itself \"Iran Security Team\" retaliated by targeting Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Statistics and King Abdulaziz University, defacing their websites with a jeering message of its own. Another team of Iranian hackers, calling themselves \"Digital Boys Underground Team\", hacked the Saudi Commerce Ministry's website. Over the next few days, a series of apparently tit-for-tat attacks saw more websites targeted, almost all of which were defaced or rendered inaccessible by attacks. Iran's police and cyber-police force, its judiciary, national postal service and culture ministry were all targeted. There is no evidence that official organisations in either state have been directly involved in the attacks. Iran's cyber-police chief, Gen Kamal Hadinafar, said the hackers' IP addresses had been traced back to Saudi Arabia but he did not accuse the Saudi authorities. As the attacks continued, the messages left by hackers became increasingly political and hostile. Tension between the two countries rose further when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shia cleric and opposition figure in January. Protesters in Tehran ransacked and set alight the Saudi embassy. Riyadh responded by severing all diplomatic ties with Iran. With relations at an all-time low, Tehran announced a few days ago that it would bar its citizens from attending this year's Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) after negotiations over safety broke down. Last year, more than 400 Iranian pilgrims had died in a stampede, leading to a war of words between Iranian and Saudi officials. After hacking the website of Iran's foreign ministry, a hacker group calling itself \"Team Bad Dream\" branded the Iranian government the \"mother of terrorism\" and demanded an end to the \"killing of children in Iraq, Yemen and Syria\". The group tweeted that a \"cyberwar\" between Iranian and Saudi hackers had begun. In his latest attacks, Da3s pointed to the Yemen conflict and castigated the Iranian authorities for boycotting the Hajj. \"Why is Iran forbidding Muslims from attending this year's Hajj? Relations between states are unrelated to freedom of religion!\" Iranian hackers hit back by highlighting the long-standing dispute over the naming of the Gulf. Some Arab states refer to the body of water as the Arabian Gulf, but many Iranians see the name Persian Gulf as a source of national pride and object to any other form of words, including \"the Gulf\".

The Department of Health said it expected parts of the NHS to work together to resolve any deficits. The survey was organised by NHS Alliance and the National Association of Primary Care, which have joined forces to represent CCGs, who will take over buying and organising NHS services. 36% of GPs and other leaders who responded to the survey said they were under pressure from NHS managers to become bigger, so they could pass a viability test next month. And 67% suspect they will have to deal with some legacy debt from former primary care trusts (PCTs) when the new system begins in England in April 2013. Dr Michael Dixon, who heads the NHS Alliance, said: \"Having a board with other clinical representatives and allowing for audit will be expensive. \"So the CCGs need to reach a critical mass in terms of size.

Maughold was the last lighthouse to have been built on the island. Work began in 1911 and finished in April 1914. It consists of a 23m (77ft) tower, which is situated on a slope of headland at Maughold Head. \"The building of the light at Maughold Head was not an easy task,\" said Lorna Hunter from the NLB. \"The tower is positioned half way down a cliff and can only be reached by a flight of 128 steps.\" The keeper's houses, now privately owned, are situated at the top of the cliff. The coastal residence, which consists of four bedrooms and two bathrooms, was sold in 2012 for about \u00a3600,000. The area between the lighthouse and Port-Vullen is a government-protected breeding ground for more than 35 bird species, including puffins and guillemots. The original Frensel lens at Maughold was named after its French inventor, Augustin Fresnel. It is made from a series of perfectly polished crystal glass lenses set into a brass structure. The automated light, now monitored around the clock from a remote centre, is visited and maintained locally on a regular basis. However, once a year, all the lighthouses on the island are visited by the vessel, NLV Pharos, when specialised technicians undertake a full service of the equipment.", "summary": "A ceremony is to be held to mark the 100th anniversary of an Isle of Man lighthouse.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 3733}

The Welsh Government said it was reviewing Welsh councils' use of fines to punish parents who break the rules. Last year, then education minister Huw Lewis wrote to councils to say it was wrong to tell head teachers to ban all term-time leave after thousands of parents signed a petition against the \u00c2\u00a360 penalties. The number of children aged between five and 11 being removed from class for term-time holidays, without permission, has risen every year since records detailing them began in 2011-12. The number of half day sessions missed due to unauthorised holiday absences rose from 58,089 in 2011-12 to 424,760 in 2015-16. However, because the number of authorised holidays has fallen over the same period, the total number of holiday absences has fallen from 920,500 to 788,841. Mark Biltcliffe, head teacher of Drury Primary School in Flintshire and president of the National Association of Head Teachers in Wales, called for government-regulated tax incentives to discourage holiday companies from hiking up prices outside of term time. \"If people have got two or three children it is extremely expensive to go away on holiday, I think that needs looking at. \"There should be pressure on the holiday industry so they can't make these huge profits.\" He told Good Morning Wales parents often asked for worksheets so children could keep up with what they are missing, but it was \"not the same\". \"Children do need to be in school every day and if they are not there then they're missing out on the teaching output and mixing with their friends . \"It's about continuity and the input of the lesson, it's not the same doing worksheets on a beach in Spain.\" In 2011-12, unauthorised holidays accounted for 1.3% of all absences, this increased to 10.5% in 2015-16, according to Welsh Government statistics.

The percentage of secondary school pupils being taken out of class for holidays, without permission, increased from 0.8% to 3.6% in the same period.

The original documents about the case were unearthed by Ann Dumas, co-curator of the Royal Academy's Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse exhibition. \"There was a protest from local farmers who were very suspicious of these strange aquatic plants that Monet wanted to plant because they they would poison their water and kill their cattle,\" she said. Monet, who moved to Giverny in 1883, had been able to buy land on the other side of a railway line that bordered his house. It was here he wanted to create his water garden by diverting the river Epte, a tributary of the Seine. Dumas said Monet acquired planning permission for his garden \"after a lot of difficulty\". \"The farmers were suspicious of Monet anyway,\" she added. \"He kept himself to himself so they saw him as an outsider.

The Reverend Dr Crispin Pailing, rector of Liverpool, said: \"A significant number of the crew and passengers had Liverpool connections - there is hardly a street in the Vauxhall area that wasn't affected.\" The ship's owner Cunard has commissioned a memorial plaque, which will be dedicated later during a service at Liverpool Parish Church. Actors Joe McGann and Roy Carruthers will read first-hand accounts from survivors.

Taking the pills while pregnant without medical approval is illegal in the UK. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said as awareness of the online pills increased, more women were using them. The figures, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - which regulates medicines in the UK - show there were 375 pills seized last year, up from 270 in 2015 and 180 in 2014. The seizures were made during the MHRA's annual week-long raids, known as Operation Pangea, at places like postal hubs where foreign post is kept before being distributed to local post offices. NHS abortion treatment is free and widely available in Britain, but remains mostly illegal in Northern Ireland. However, the UK currently has the harshest punishment for self-induced abortion of any country in Europe, bar the Republic of Ireland. Under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, anyone taking the pills could, in theory, be punished with a life sentence - no matter what the gestational period. Two women have been jailed for using the abortion pill bought online in the UK. In 2012, 40-year-old Sarah Catt was jailed for eight years for terminating her pregnancy with pills she had bought online when she was 39 weeks pregnant. Natalie Towers, 26, was sentenced to two-and-a half-years in 2015 after using the pill to terminate her pregnancy while she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant. Bpas and other women's groups are supporting a bill, proposed by Labour MP Diana Johnson, to be debated in the House of Commons next month, which seeks to decriminalise abortion. Some women have revealed why they were driven to using abortion pills purchased online. \"I was hoping to have a termination in the comfort of my own home without judgmental eyes and without worrying about my husband knowing. I fear what would happen if he did,\" one woman said. \"I have three children and my third is 11 months old. I considered an abortion when he was conceived and had a terrible pregnancy and [I am] still suffering from post natal depression.\" Another, a foreign student living in the UK, said she felt \"desperate\". \"I cannot afford this country's prices of procedure, and the place in line for supported abortions is just too long and not guaranteed. \"I feel absolutely horrible and desperate.\" Clara Watson, education officer for the charity Life, said the promotion of buying abortion pills online was dangerous. \"Some women aren't suitable for the abortion pill and may suffer from blood clots, there may be other underlying health issues, they may not know how far along they are. It's too risky,\" she said. Ann Furedi, Bpas chief executive, said women who bought the pills were often \"desperate\" and in \"difficult circumstances\". \"At Bpas, we do all that we can to make abortion services as accessible as possible. However, it is clear that for some women the barriers to clinic-based treatment feel insurmountable,\" she said. \"They are not criminals deserving of life imprisonment. Evidence suggests that as awareness of online abortion pills is increasing, so too are the numbers of women using these methods.\" She said women should not face criminal punishment. \"Fifty years after the 1967 Act was passed, it is time to bring women's reproductive healthcare into the 21st Century and remove abortion from the criminal law,\" she added. \"By doing so we would remove the clinically unnecessary legal barriers to treatment.\" She also urged women in need of advice or help to contact Bpas.

The Justice Department has been scrutinising Baltimore police after accusing it last August of systemic racism and abusing power. The officers \"arrogantly\" ignored clear directives, a police official said. Police Commissioner Kevin Davis condemned the officers at a news conference. \"These officers are 1930s-style gangsters,\" Mr Davis said. \"They betrayed the trust we're trying to build with our community at a very sensitive time in our history.\" The seven officers are: Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Daniel Hersl, Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, Jemell Rayam, Marcus Taylor and Maurice Ward. Mr Gondo is also charged with participating in a drug conspiracy. All of the men were arrested, suspended without pay and jailed, pending detention hearings on Thursday. Federal prosecutors said the men began their criminal enterprise in 2015, after the city erupted into protest over the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, while he was in police custody. The Justice Department later opened a \"pattern and practice\" investigation into the police force, finding that the department routinely discriminated against black people and used excessive force. Federal agents by then had spent months following officers on the Gun Trace Task Force, which was formed to crack down on violent crime by tracking illegal guns on the streets. Prosecutors accuse the men of committing robberies and filing false reports to conceal their crimes. In one instance, four of the officers arrested a man during a traffic stop and confiscated drugs as well as $21,500 (\u00c2\u00a317,516). The officers only submitted $15,000 as evidence, and then later went to the man's home and stole $200,000 and a $4,000 watch from a safe deposit box. In another incident, three of the officers stopped a man on the street, searched his car without a warrant and later took $1,500 he had earned working as a maintenance supervisor at a nursing home. The charges were announced a day after US Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested that he might ease federal scrutiny of law enforcement across the country as it could undermine their policing ability. Baltimore was one of dozens of US cities to face a federal civil rights probe under the Obama administration. The city and the Justice Department had reached a court-enforceable consent decree in January requiring police to make sweeping changes to its practices. Mr Obama made police reform a priority in the wake of mounting racial tension and high-profile police shootings across the country.

It urged countries to act as stewards of God's creation. The statements are likely to influence the Pope's coming Encyclical on climate change. An Cambridge Economics professor, Partha Dasgupta, told the academy's climate conference in the Vatican: \"GDP is a disgraceful index because it does not count depreciation of our assets - including damage to Mother Nature, the most fundamental asset we have.\" Cardinal Peter Turkson, who helped write the coming Encyclical - an official statement - said: \"For humans to degrade the integrity of the Earth by constant changes in its climate; by stripping its natural forests; to contaminate Earth's water, land and air with poisonous substances - all of these are sins. \"There is an all-embracing imperative to protect our garden, our hope. We must move away from our unthinking infatuation with GDP.\" The academy heard speech after speech urging the moral case for protecting the climate for future generations. Meanwhile, a small group funded by a US climate contrarian body in Chicago has been in Rome rallying against the Vatican's climate drive. One of the participants, Christopher Monckton, said the Pope \"should listen to both sides of the scientific argument... not only people of one, narrow, poisonous political and scientific viewpoint\". Inside the conference itself, the astronomer Lord Rees, former President of the UK's Royal Society, was putting just such a balanced view. He acknowledged uncertainties over climate science, especially over how water vapour and clouds would react to warming. He said some people were willing to bet on a low level of warming, mitigated later in the century by new technologies more affordable in a richer economy. But, he said, the risks of triggering an irreversible catastrophe lasting thousands of years was too great. \"It would be shameful if our inheritance was a depleted and hazardous world,\" he said. The Church is hoping to make an impact in a year of key UN meetings on Sustainable Development Goals, development finance and climate. The Encyclical is expected to describe action to cut emissions as \"a moral and religious imperative, highlighting the intrinsic connection between respect for the environment and respect for people - especially the poor, children, and future generations\". The Pope is hoping to build agreement among all religions on the moral obligation to protect the environment. Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who heads the Academy, said the Encyclical would not be the highest level of proclamation from the Pope, which is reserved for issues of Faith. But he said it was important for all the world's 1.2 billion Catholics to take it seriously. If any Catholic wanted to ignore it they would need \"very good reasons - based not on personal or political opinion, but on science\". For some Catholics, this may prove an unwelcome Papal intervention into a highly politicised subject. But the aid agency Cafod said its poll with YouGov showed the vast majority (70%) of Catholics say their community will heed the message of the Pope on climate change.

The EU is keen to maintain a united front and conduct central negotiations. Meanwhile, a leading candidate to be France's next President says he will take a \"pretty tough\" line on Brexit. Emmanuel Macron, who opinion polls suggest could win May's election, told Channel 4 News the UK should not be punished for voting to leave the EU but the EU's interests had to be paramount into the upcoming negotiations. \"We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequence,\" he said. Official discussions on the terms of the UK's exit and its future relationship with the EU are expected to begin in the Spring once the UK has triggered Article 50 - notifying the union of its intention to leave. Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear that the UK will leave the EU's single market and wants bespoke commercial and customs agreements based on tariff-free and \"frictionless\" cross-border trade. She has also made clear that she is prepared to leave the EU without a formal deal rather sign up to a bad one. The final agreement on the UK's exit will need the approval of 20 out of the EU's 27 other member states as well as the support of the European Parliament. However, a future trade deal could need the backing of all EU states. There have been suggestions the UK could potentially exploit divisions within the EU over how hard a bargain they are willing to drive. Several EU leaders have insisted the UK cannot expect a better deal outside the EU than it has now and their priority is to protect the interests of the remaining 27 members. Others have advised against \"punishing\" the UK. Speaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals. \"A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,\" he said. \"It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions... with certain individual countries.\" Mr Kern said that Europe would not \"capitulate\" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member. \"If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,\" he said. The EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier.

{"text": "In passing the law that allows legal action against Saudi Arabia over the 9/11 attacks, Congress over-ruled a veto by Mr Obama for the first time in his presidency. So why is it so controversial, and what are its wider implications? The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) was brought by the families of 9/11 victims, to allow them to sue any member of the Saudi government suspected of playing a role in the attacks. In practice, the bill permits civil claims against a foreign state or official for injuries, death, or damages from an act of international terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 terrorist who hijacked planes on 9/11 were Saudi nationals, and it has long been rumoured that senior Saudi officials were in some way linked to the attack. Official inquiries since 2001 have found there is no evidence of either the Saudi government or senior Saudi individuals funding al-Qaeda. However, a previously classified document earlier this year revealed \"while in the United States, some of the 9/11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi government\". While the document did not provide any direct evidence of top-level Saudi involvement, it did raise new questions. A veto is one of the most significant tools an American president has at his disposal, and has been used more than 2,500 times in America's history to prevent the passage of legislation. According to the US' House of Representatives, even the threat of a veto can bring about changes. Congress can overrule a veto however - but only if it has the support of two-thirds of the House and Senate. This has only happened on 110 occasions since 1792. Despite this, it is unusual for a president in recent years to get through two terms without congress overruling a veto. George W Bush had four overturned, while Bill Clinton had two during his tenure. The last presidency to go unchallenged was that of Lyndon B Johnson. President Barack Obama, who has only used a veto on 12 occasions and had, until now, never had one overruled, fears the amended law will leave America open to similar suits from other countries - especially as there is little consensus internationally on what constitutes an act of terrorism. Stephen Vladeck, professor of law at the University of Texas, explained: \"The real concern is that the more the US weakens the concept of foreign sovereign immunity, the more that the weakening will be used against it. \"President Obama is concerned that [something like] a drone strike against a suspected al-Qaeda target in Yemen or Pakistan or Somalia could very well be deemed by those countries as terrorism which could subject the US to significant liability in those courts.\" But Terry Strada, national chair for 9/11 Families United For Justice Against Terrorism, has disagreed that the bill could backfire in the way the White House has warned. \"If we're not funding terrorist organisations and killing people, then we don't have anything to worry about,\" she said. The bill may also have an impact on relations with Saudi Arabia, a key ally for the US in the Middle East. Salman al-Ansari, president of the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee, said Saudi Arabia could reduce valuable security and intelligence co-operation as a result. The idea was to \"clear away\" obstacles and force an American court to answer whether and to what extent the Saudi government was involved in the 9/11 attacks. But Professor Vladeck says in its creation the bill has created more blocks which will \"probably\" lead to \"more litigation\". And even if the outcome is successful for the families, it will be little more than symbolic, he believes. \"The problem with JASTA is, it does not allow an American court to seize Saudi assets, or any foreign sovereign's assets, for this kind of claim,\" he says. \"So the best the plaintiffs can hope for is a piece of paper that says, yes the Saudi government was indirectly responsible because of funding, no you don't get any damages.\"", "summary": "US President Barack Obama has described it as \"one of the worst pieces of legislation that I've ever seen\".", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states a quote from Obama not mentioned in the source text."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3743}

But Commons leader Chris Grayling, in Caerphilly, said the Brexit case was an \"overwhelmingly positive one\". He was campaigning in the south Wales valleys for a Leave vote alongside Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, Monmouth Tory MP David Davies, and UKIP AMs Nathan Gill and Mark Reckless. The two sides have been stepping up their campaigns with just one week to go before the UK's in-out referendum on 23 June. Talking to BBC Wales in Cardiff city centre on Thursday, Mr Salmond agreed the vote was close, describing it as \"nip and tuck\". \"There's going to be a strong remain vote in Scotland as in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"I'm hoping for a Remain vote in Wales to make it a Celtic triple, as it were. \"It's on a knife edge in England.\" Mr Salmond predicted a \"surge of European enthusiasm\" as \"you go deep into the European football championships\". \"What the campaign has been missing has been the positive aspect of Europe,\" he said.

{"text": "The Six Nations' annual start could move from February to April with bonus points and promotion and relegation being introduced. Davies says the current demands on players are \"unsustainable\", prompting talks over a \"global season\". He says the WRU held \"discussions\" with New Zealand in June over the issue. Recently installed World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said moving the Six Nations to April \"could be a solution\" in a global calendar. The idea was on the agenda in 2003 amid concerns over fixture overlaps and clashes between clubs and countries. In 2014 the Rugby Players' Association, representing players in England, urged changes to the playing calendar for the sake of player welfare. Davies witnessed Wales' 18-Test season ending in a 3-0 whitewash against the All Blacks in June, a year after preparations for the 2015 World Cup started. \"The main reason for the global season is player welfare, to try to cut down the numbers of games players are playing,\" Davies told BBC Radio Wales. \"Our guys were in New Zealand in June, July. They started training the first week of June the previous year. \"The New Zealand guys couldn't get over it. These guys had been going for 13 months playing international rugby - that is not sustainable. \"And it was a World Cup year and exceptional year etc, finishing with the New Zealand tour.\" For southern hemisphere teams, hosting rivals from the northern hemisphere also disrupts their Super Rugby domestic tournament calendar. Davies added: \"Basically they want us to move a month or so so they can have a clear run-in. \"I think we see it, just moving three or four weeks is not going to help the northern hemisphere with player welfare, for example. \"So it is a bigger question than just the Six Nations. That is being looked at at the moment. \"There's a Six Nations council meeting at the end of this month and this isn't to fuel speculation, it is an annual review of where the Six Nations sits. \"So is it worth considering moving it? Do we look at bonus points, which is something that people have asked for to make it more exciting, scoring tries etc? \"Do we look at 'is it a closed shop for Six Nations?' Do we open the gates to Georgia, Romania or anybody else who is deemed worthy and is capable of being in there? \"So all those are up for grabs really. \"Moving the Six Nations - I don't see it as a problem if it helps other things. \"I don't think we need to move it for the sake of it because it does work where it is now - it gets huge following, huge TV audiences etc. \"But if it were necessary to move it in order that it were a piece of the jigsaw that enabled northern and southern hemispheres to have a coherent global season, then it's worth doing.\" Wales' next international fixture is against Australia at the Principality Stadium on Saturday, 5 November.

In the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, one in 10 of the medical staff positions were vacant. The Welsh government said there were difficulties recruiting A&E doctors.

A number of dignitaries including NI First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness are at the requiem mass. Members of his Gaelic football club joined his police colleagues in a highly symbolic guard of honour. 'Appalling' No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but dissident republicans have been blamed. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Wednesday morning, Irish prime minister Enda Kenny strongly condemned the attack. \"To those who think they are doing something for Ireland, this is a warped mentality,\" he said. \"It is the mentality of the past, a very dark and violent past and it has no part in the future.\" He said Constable Kerr had been in the \"prime of life\" and it was \"appalling\" for his life to be taken from him. \"It does nothing for any community in this country,\" he added. The Gaelic Athletic Association administers a number of sports including Gaelic football and hurling which are among the most popular in Ireland. Unprecedented . Its joint involvement with the PSNI in the funeral service is unprecedented and has been described as highly symbolic. The GAA previously banned the security forces from being members but this rule was lifted after the PSNI was formed out of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 2001. Dissident republicans remain opposed to the police and have repeatedly targeted officers in both gun and bomb attacks. Last year, Peadar Heffron, who captained the PSNI Gaelic football team, had a leg amputated after a similar booby-trap attack on his car. Constable Kerr was a member of the Beragh Red Knights GAA club. Its chairman Gerard Treacy said it was right that the GAA and the PSNI should \"show solidarity with one another\" at the funeral. \"Our community has been attacked and so the community of the PSNI been attacked and today shoulder to shoulder we will stand together in solidarity and show the people of Ireland and the world that this sort of despicable action is not going to be tolerated,\" he said. 'Overwhelming' messages . NI Secretary Owen Paterson is representing the British Government at the funeral. It is also being attended by Irish opposition leader Micheal Martin, the Ulster Unionist Party leader Tom Elliott and several NI church leaders. PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott and his counterpart from the Irish police Martin Callinan are also present. Catholic primate Cardinal Sean Brady is leading the funeral mass and Father John Skinnader, a cousin of Ronan's mother Nuala, is giving the homily. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has organised a lunchtime rally in Belfast on Wednesday to allow people to express their abhorrence at the killing. Books of condolence have been opened across Northern Ireland, while on its Facebook page the PSNI said it had been \"overwhelmed by messages of sympathy and support\". On Tuesday, the Crimestoppers charity offered a \u00c2\u00a350,000 reward for information leading to those responsible for the murder. Constable Kerr, who joined the police in May 2010, is the second officer to have been killed since the Royal Ulster Constabulary became the PSNI in 2001.

{"text": "Rebecca Allen, director of Education Datalab, says research has found \"incredibly reliable\" marking available overseas costing \u00c2\u00a32 to \u00c2\u00a33 per hour. Dr Allen says there needed to be more radical approaches to cutting workload. But heads' leader Brian Lightman said he would have \"serious concerns\" about regularly outsourcing marking. Mr Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: \"Marking of pupils' work is an integral part of the professional duties of a teacher.\" Dr Allen, speaking at an Education Media Centre event, suggested that even though all political parties backed the idea of cutting workload for teachers, there were few practical measures to achieve this and \"radically different ways\" should be considered. She said schools should consider re-thinking some of the most time-consuming activities, such as marking pupils' work. \"We've got to look elsewhere. We can't just say things like 'paperwork'. I think we need to be realistic and think in radical ways about things like marking,\" said Dr Allen, who is also reader in the economics of education at the UCL Institute of Education. Marking remained popular with parents and was seen as providing evidence for inspections and so teachers were likely to remain under pressure to carry on with large amounts of marking. As such she suggested that there needed to be more imaginative ways of tackling the workload. One approach could be to \"outsource marking\". She said research projects had found accurate marking could be carried out overseas, in countries such as India, for about \u00c2\u00a33 per hour or less. Another approach likely to be explored was using computer technology, she said. There have already been some experiments with outsourcing the marking of vocational qualifications, with candidates' answers being scanned into a computer system in the UK to be checked by staff in India. But heads' leader Mr Lightman said: \"Whilst we would agree that technology can, in appropriate cases be used to process some assessments, I would have serious concerns about outsourcing routine marking. \"Teachers need to see pupils' work themselves so that they can fully understand the degree to which their pupils have understood what has been taught. \"Schools must be resourced adequately to provide them with the time to do this. \"The unnecessary workload surrounding marking has been caused by a high stakes accountability system which places teachers under intense pressure to provide 'evidence' to justify their assessment decisions.\" Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"Teachers don't just look at the rightness or wrongness of the student's answer - they want to understand and support the student's learning process. Outsourcing doesn't help at all with assessment for learning.\" Teachers' unions have frequently complained that excessive workload is one of the major problems for the teaching profession. It has been blamed as a barrier for recruiting teachers and a reason for those leaving the profession. And earlier this year, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised that they wanted to find \"decisive measures\" to \"tackle the root causes of unnecessary teacher workload\".", "summary": "Schools should consider outsourcing the marking of pupils' work to countries such as India, an education expert says.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1271}

He said he also wanted to improve transport, schools and broadband in rural areas to boost the rural economy. But Labour said the plans were ignoring the need for more affordable homes. The chancellor wants to extend the government's \"starter homes\" scheme, announced before the election for brownfield sites, to some villages. The initiative offers young local first-time home buyers a 20% discount on the price of the property. As it stands, the discount will be offered on homes up to \u00c2\u00a3250,000 outside London and \u00c2\u00a3450,000 inside London. The measures are part of Mr Osborne's new rural productivity plan, which will be unveiled later. Steve Reed, Labour's shadow local government minister, said the Conservatives' housing policies had made things worse for people in rural communities. \"The government says it wants to build starter homes in rural areas but it seems these will replace affordable homes to buy and rent - starter homes should be additional to affordable housing supply not instead of it,\" he said. \"In many rural areas buying or renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable. Yet the government has undermined the provision of affordable housing at every step by watering down requirements on developers to build new affordable homes.\" Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Osborne said rural areas were an increasingly dynamic part of the economy, with 60,000 people moving from the city to the countryside each year. He has pledged to continue to protect the Green Belt but said he wanted to \"make it easier for people to stay in their rural communities and for newcomers to settle there too\". He and Environment Secretary Liz Truss write in their joint newspaper editorial: \"For rural areas, we want better internet and mobile phone communications, better transport, better schools, better skills, better housing, better business growth and better local government. \"And we'll look at planning and regulatory constraints facing rural businesses. In a recent survey of rural businesses the main barrier to growth that most identified was planning restrictions. \"So for a start, we'll review rules around agricultural buildings such as barns to allow rural businesses to expand more easily.\" The Campaign for Rural England said it welcomed the government's recognition that rural areas could boost the economy, but it voiced concern that the \"beautiful English countryside\" was at risk of \"inappropriate developments\". Planning officer John Rowley said: \"We recognise that providing the right houses in the right places that meet local need is a vital part of ensuring our villages remain vibrant and sustainable. \"However, the proposals risk alienating local communities and reducing the amount of affordable housing in rural areas. The government's suggestion that young families will be able to afford houses at even 20% discount will not ring true in many low-waged rural economies.\" He added it was likely that commuters would be able to outbid local families, taking advantage of the discount which would not continue on resale - and therefore there would be no incentive for local people to back any new developments.", "summary": "First-time home buyers in rural areas will get a discount on the price of properties under plans to be announced by the chancellor.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary makes up that the discount is for rural areas", "The summary states that first-time home buyers \"will get\" a discount, but the text only mentions that the chancellor \"wants to\" extend the scheme, indicating it is a proposal and not yet implemented."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3659}

The Mount, in Bovingdon village near Hemel Hempstead, opened in 1987 and is classed as a category C male prison. A \"tornado team\" made up of riot-trained staff arrived at the jail at about 18:30, equipped with shields and batons while fire, police and ambulance crews were on standby outside. The MoJ said officers had dealt with an \"incident involving a number of prisoners\". The BBC understands the wings involved were H and L, which house 110 and 117 prisoners. At about 23:45, a Prison Service spokesperson said: \"Specialist prison staff resolved an incident involving a number of prisoners.

It also claimed violence \"grew considerably\" throughout the year and that drugs were readily available, in particular the synthetic cannabis substitute spice. The report says concerns raised last year had not been addressed by the MoJ. The Prison Reform Trust calls this type of institution one where \"prison staff think [inmates] will not escape\", while acknowledging they \"cannot be trusted in an open prison\".

{"text": "Juliano Pinto, a 29-year-old with complete paralysis of the lower trunk, performed the symbolic kick-off at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo. Using his robotic suit, Mr Pinto kicked the official ball a short distance along a mat laid down by the touchline. But some observers argued the historic event was not given the attention it deserved during the opening ceremony. The identity of the young volunteer was kept a secret until after the event. His robotic exoskeleton was created by a team of more than 150 researchers led by Brazilian neuroscientist Dr Miguel Nicolelis. Dr Nicolelis tweeted called the event a \"great team effort\" and afterwards tweeted: \"We did it!!!\" \"It was up to Juliano to wear the exoskeleton, but all of them made that shot. It was a big score by these people and by our science,\" he commented. The neuroscientist, who is based at Duke University in the US, is a leading figure in the field of brain-machine interfaces. In breakthrough work published in 2003, he showed that monkeys could control the movement of virtual arms on an avatar using just their brain activity. The scientists have been working under the banner of a consortium called the Walk Again Project. In a statement, the consortium said the World Cup demonstration would be \"just the beginning\" of a future \"in which people with paralysis may abandon the wheelchair and literally walk again\". But some TV networks didn't capture the event, prompting criticism on Twitter. Some commentators also took aim at ceremony organisers for apparently sidelining the moment in favour of performing acts. Dr Nicolelis had been training eight patients at his lab in Sao Paulo, all of whom were over 20 years of age, with the oldest about 35. \"It's the first time an exoskeleton has been controlled by brain activity and offered feedback to the patients,\" Dr Nicolelis, a neuroscientist at Duke University, told the AFP news agency . \"Doing a demonstration in a stadium is something very much outside our routine in robotics. It's never been done before.\" The exoskeleton uses a cap placed on the patient's head to pick up brain signals and relay them to a computer in the exoskeleton's backpack. This then decodes the signals and sends them to the legs. The robotic suit is powered by hydraulics, and a battery in the backpack allows for approximately two hours of use. \"The basic idea is that we are recording from the brain and then that signal is being translated into commands for the robot to start moving,\" Dr Gordon Cheng, at the Technical University of Munich, who is a member of the team, told the BBC in May. Dr Cheng led the development of a form of artificial skin for the exoskeleton. This skin consists of flexible printed circuit boards, each containing pressure, temperature and speed sensors. It is applied on the soles of the feet and allows the patient to receive tactile stimulation when walking with the exoskeleton. When the robotic suit starts to move and touches the ground, signals are transmitted to an electronic vibration device on the patient's arm, which stimulates their skin. After lots of practice, the brain starts associating the movements of the legs with the vibration in the arm. In theory, the patient should start to develop the sensation that they have legs and that they are walking. The suit has been named Bra-Santos Dumont, which combines the three-letter designation for Brazil and Alberto Santos-Dumont, the aviation pioneer who was born in the country's southern state of Minas Gerais.", "summary": "A paralysed Brazilian man has kicked a football during the opening ceremony of the 2014 Fifa World Cup.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary makes up his nationality, ", "The summary makes up the year of the World Cup"], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3387}
{"text": "Ms Allred spoke at a press conference alongside three women who said they had been abused by Mr Cosby. Mr Cosby, 77, is facing a series of renewed allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted over a dozen women. His lawyers describe the claims as \"discredited\" and \"defamatory\". Mr Cosby has had television shows cancelled and some appearances dropped in recent weeks amid the allegations. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Ms Allred said many of the alleged victims had contacted her to determine what legal rights they had. \"Unfortunately, I had to tell them it was too late for them to file a lawsuit against Bill Cosby because of the statute of limitations - for most women it is simply too late to have their day in court,\" she told reporters. The women's rights lawyer presented two courses of action to, in her words, \"determine whether Bill Cosby is a saint or a sexual predator\". Firstly, she suggested Mr Cosby waive the statute of limitations to allow the alleged victims to present their claims and for him to present his defence. The second option, she said, would be for Mr Cosby to place $100m (\u00c2\u00a364m) in a fund, from which a panel of retired judges would decide what compensation would be appropriate if a woman's claim was found to have merit. Three women then gave accounts of the alleged attacks, with two saying they had been drugged before being assaulted. When asked how many women had contacted her to make a claim, Ms Allred said: \"I literally have lost count.\" The press conference came a day after another woman filed a lawsuit against Mr Cosby over allegations of sexual assault when she was under-age - said to be the first such claim to come to light. Judy Huth says she was 15 when she was molested by the comedian at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. As she was minor at the time, her case can still be heard. Earlier this week, Bill Cosby resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia, where he was once a student, amid the allegations. Several broadcasters have also shelved projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix. Two of his performances scheduled for the weekend at a venue in the north of New York were cancelled on Wednesday, AP reports.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls cut short his visit to South America to return to France which is on its highest state of alert after the attack in the small town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier some 40km (25 miles) from Lyon. Officials and residents of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier gathered outside the town hall on Saturday morning to observe a minute's silence. Mr Salhi was arrested at the Air Products factory on Friday morning. Later, anti-terror police searched the apartment of Mr Salhi, a father-of-three, in the Moines neighbourhood of the town. They took his wife and sister into custody. Another man was arrested but released without charge. Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office, has said police have so far not found any motive or possible foreign connection, and that Mr Salhi is not speaking to investigators. Under French anti-terrorism laws, suspects can be held for up to four days before either being released or charged. Yassin Salhi had been investigated in the past about his alleged links with Islamist militants. It is alleged he was waved through the gates of the factory because he was a regular delivery driver. Police and firefighters later found a half-destroyed car which had been rammed into canisters containing chemicals and a man trying to ignite more. Mr Salhi's boss, a 54-year-old man whose name has not been released by police, was found beheaded at the scene. His head had been placed on the factory railings. It is not clear when he died. Speaking after the attack, President Hollande said: \"We have no doubt that the attack was to blow up the building.

{"text": "He was a multi-millionaire property developer with a wife and family going through a \"mid-life crisis\", she was the \u00a310,000-a-month escort he pinned his hopes for a future on. Former burlesque dancer and stripper Georgina Symonds enjoyed the trappings of being with millionaire Peter Morgan - spa days, exclusive luxury hotel stays, a BMW and a Range Rover. He housed her rent-free in a bungalow in the vast grounds of the castle in Llanmartin, Newport, south Wales, he owned and gave her cash-in-hand to pay the bills, as well as paying for her to have full-body liposuction. Morgan, from a prominent and wealthy Welsh farming family, was infatuated with and hoped to build a future with the dancer he called \"George\", the woman for whom he left his wife of 23 years, the mother of his two children. Miss Symonds' childhood best friend Nadine Tilley said: \"She told me she was really happy and things were going well. She said he treated her well.\" But when Miss Symonds' on/off boyfriend Peter Deem and her father both killed themselves within six months of one another, she turned to drink and drugs to cope. She started to blame Morgan, of Llanellen, near Abergavenny, for Mr Deem's suicide in November 2015, and for a meeting she then had with social services about the welfare of her daughter. Her mother and friends watched her verbally abuse him repeatedly, and said he \"just stood there and took it\" whilst remaining \"calm\". Mother Deborah Symonds told the murder trial at Newport Crown Court: \"She was trying to do things to upset him, to make him feel hurt but I don't think anything could make him hurt. \"That's what she said she was doing it for. She wanted him to have a bit of pain.\" Morgan planted a listening device in her home which he nicknamed \"Isobel\" - which was essentially a SIM card and microphone hidden in an adaptor he could ring in to listen through. He said this was to monitor her drug use rather than spy on her, but he phoned the device 514 times during 10 weeks. Then, in January 2016, he overheard the mother-of-one on the phone talking about blackmailing him to \"fleece him\" for everything he had. Morgan, who had been seeing Miss Symonds for three years, knew she had sexually explicit photos and films of them having sex in his wife's home and the marital bed, and that she had previously successfully blackmailed at least three former clients. That night Morgan made a precise murder \"to do\" list on his phone, strangling Miss Symonds the next day in her home with orange baling twine. Before leaving the scene of the murder he fed Miss Symonds' three Jack Russells, did the washing up and put out the rubbish. He wrapped her body up in polythene sheeting and duct tape and put it in his car boot, before hiding it in a workshop at his estranged wife's farm in Beech Hill Farm in Usk, south Wales. Morgan then went about his daily business, including visiting the bank and going to the building site he was developing at that time, saying he just wanted to get back to his routine. He told police it was not until he got a phone call saying Miss Symonds had not picked up her daughter from school that he remembered he had strangled her to death. Later that night he confessed to killing her and, while refusing legal help, gave the police a detailed account of the events leading to her death. Despite this he pleaded not guilty to murder, pleading diminished responsibility due to having Asperger syndrome. The unusual defence was that the syndrome - a collection of personality traits - meant Mr Morgan had diminished responsibility and had committed manslaughter rather than murder. It was a complex argument built around the premise that Morgan saw things in such a black and white way he felt forced into a course of action someone else would not normally take. Giving evidence in the trial consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Phillip Joseph said Asperger syndrome could provide \"an explanation\" for the killing. He said: \"If he suffers from the condition it is at the very least a significant contributing factor.\" Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, the difference being the person suffering from it does not have learning difficulties. They may have a very binary way of thinking, have difficulties communicating and crave routine and predictability rather than change. Someone with Asperger syndrome may also have very particular, obsessive interests, which they are keen to tell others about. Director of the Autism Research Centre Professor Simon Baron-Cohen told the court although there is not much research on Asperger syndrome and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in murder, there was growing awareness of how it could lead to the crime in a small number of cases. He added: \"There are an increasing number of cases that the courts are hearing about. When the alleged involved find themselves trapped in a certain way they might resort just through logic alone to the idea that they have to get rid of the person who is causing the threat. This is just an impression there is insufficient research to draw solid conclusions yet.\" Morgan himself, who had built two successful businesses and was married with children, was said to initially find it inconceivable he could have Asperger syndrome. But Prof Baron-Cohen, who diagnosed Morgan just before the trial, said it explained a lot of the millionaire's actions both during and before the murder. He pointed to the businessman's preference to fix up machines rather than spend time with people, and his obsession with machinery and military history. Morgan kept excavators, cranes, tanks, an old American fire engine and motorbikes at his home, where he displayed his collection of guns such as an Uzi submachine gun, an AK-47 and Mossberg sawn-off shotgun on the walls. \"His accounts of his social relationships are not that", "summary": "As Peter Morgan is found guilty of murdering Georgina Symonds, the BBC News website looks at how the relationship between the couple turned sour.", "human_descriptions": ["The source text indicates Morgan pleaded not guilty to murder, claiming diminished responsibility due to Asperger syndrome.

They also joined in with equally disaffected Charlton Athletic supporters in the joint 'pigs might fly' pitch protest in the away match at The Valley in October. Coventry have had some success in the Football League Trophy, reaching the two-leg Northern final in 2012-13, before going out in the Southern semis in 2014-15.

{"text": "Bowie received posthumous nominations for best British male and best album, for his haunting swansong Blackstar. After a row over diversity at last year's ceremony, the rest of the best male category comprises artists from BAME backgrounds. Craig David, Kano, Michael Kiwanuka and Skepta, who beat Bowie at the Mercury Prize, are all up for the title. Skepta has three nominations in total, with additional nods in the best breakthrough and best album categories. Girl band Little Mix also have three - including best group and best single, for their song Shout Out To My Ex. Meanwhile, Beyonce and her younger sister Solange Knowles are both up for best international female, after releasing albums about race and politics last year. Brit Awards 2017: Nominations in full . There were calls for a boycott of last year's Brits, after BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) artists were absent from all but the international categories. Organisers later overhauled the voting system, improving the representation of both women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Grime star Stormzy, who called the Brits \"embarrassing\" in his single One Take Freestyle, this year receives a nomination in the best British breakthrough category. Craig David said he felt grime, urban and R&B artists had excelled themselves in the past year. \"What they're doing for British music is pivotal, and it's moving a whole scene forward,\" he told BBC News. \"Diversity is the key,\" added Michael Kiwanuka. \"I don't think it's about just skin colour. \"When you put a record on, it's about seeing things from a different perspective. It's deeper than what someone looks like, and I think the Brits are reflecting that.\" However, David said it would be hard for his fellow best male nominees to compete against Bowie. \"His career has been so epic. He influenced me and so many other artists. There's no competition.\" The best female category sees competition between Ellie Goulding, Lianne La Havas, Emeli Sande, NAO and Anohni - who formerly performed under the name Antony and the Johnsons. In the international categories, there was also recognition for Leonard Cohen, who died late last year. For the first time, the nominations were revealed in a live programme on ITV1. The show included performances from best international female nominee Christine & The Queens and Britain's Got Talent contestant Callum Scott, whose cover of Dancing On My Own was a major international hit last year. Blues singer Rag 'N' Bone Man also performed, after being presented with the Brits Critics' Choice Award, singling him out as one to watch in 2017. The prize, which has previously gone to the likes of Adele, Sam Smith and Florence + The Machine, is one of only two awards to be announced in advance. The other - the Brits Icon award - will be given to Robbie Williams. It is the 18th Brit he has won, either as a solo artist or as a member of Take That. Little Mix, Emeli Sande and The 1975 will all perform at the event, at London's O2 Arena on Wednesday, 22 February, with more acts to be announced soon. Singer Michael Buble is due to host - but it is unclear whether he will be able to fulfil the role after his son was diagnosed with cancer last year.

Mr Mbabazi is running against President Yoweri Museveni in next week's polls. Amin's rule was notorious for its brutality. He was overthrown in 1979 and died in exile in 2003. An armed forces chief under President Milton Obote, Amin seized power in a coup in 1971. He ordered the expulsion of Uganda's Asian community a year later. He became infamous for his capricious behaviour and for his punishment of political opponents. Some 400,000 people are estimated to have been killed while he was in power. Amin fled Uganda in 1979, seeking refuge in Libya, Iraq and eventually Saudi Arabia, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Mr Mbabazi made his promise to repatriate Amin's remains on a visit to the former dictator's ancestral home in north-west Uganda. His spokeswoman said his party was campaigning for reconciliation and for the \"forgiveness for any real or perceived wrongs in the past\". \"The issue of Idi Amin is one of them,\" she told the AFP news agency. Mr Mbabazi meanwhile told the state-owned New Vision newspaper that he wanted to end \"the labelling of Ugandans\" as Amin's people, Obote's people and Museveni's people.

That has led to some suggestions that the BBC could stop showing Saturday night light entertainment programmes.

The show should certainly not compete for viewers with X Factor on ITV, he told the paper. On Sunday, Mr Whittingdale told Andrew Marr he was a \"huge admirer\" of the BBC. But he said he was \"a little surprised that the BBC expressed such disappointment at the Green Paper\". He said the document was \"just a series of questions with no answers as yet decided\".

The couple said: \"We would like to take this opportunity on George's first birthday to thank everyone over the last year, wherever we have met them, both at home and overseas, for their warm and generous good wishes to George and our family.\" The duke and duchess are expected to hold a birthday party for the young prince on Tuesday at their Kensington Palace apartment. Prince George was first revealed to the public on the steps of St Mary's hospital in London on 23 July 2013. The couple and their son were also warmly welcomed when they travelled to New Zealand and Australia on a royal visit. An image of Prince George was released on Sunday and the new pictures published on Monday night complete the set. One shows the young royal fascinated by a blue morpho butterfly, which has landed on his father's hand. The other image shows the two future kings and the Duchess of Cambridge looking at an object above their heads. The pictures were taken a few weeks ago at London's Natural History Museum by the Press Association's John Stillwell. Just like many of the other 2,200 babies born in the UK on the same day, last year, George Alexander Louis will mark his birthday with a party. His though, will be at a palace and his guest of honour will be his great-grandmother, the Queen. Prince George offers the institution she has served for decades the prospect of renewal, but not - as things stand - for many years to come, after the reigns of his grandfather and his father. For now, the emphasis will be on him leading as normal a life as possible - not easy when you're a prince growing up in a palace - and on shielding the child, destined to be a king, from too much public exposure. But George will continue to fascinate and he will continue to be showered with presents. A Kenyan women's group has given the baby prince, who will one day inherit the Duchy of Cornwall's 53,000 hectares, two fattened bulls, a heifer and a goat. Sir Michael Dixon, director of the Natural History Museum, said: \"It was a real pleasure to host our patron and her family earlier this month.

But with inflation standing at 2.6%, real earnings still fell by 0.5%, the ONS figures showed. At 75.1%, the proportion of people in work is the highest it has been since 1971 - partly due to the introduction of a later state pension age for women.

Pay rises improved, up by 2.1% (excluding bonuses) compared with a consensus prediction of 2%. The increase prompted some economists to suggest that wages may finally be responding to an economy which is closing in on full employment. It remains, however, a long way short of what would be required to trigger the sort of wage-price spiral about which central bankers have been hyper-vigilant since the 1970s. That employees are prepared to accept wages that shrink by a tiny bit less than they did the last time these figures came out does not exactly bespeak a dramatic new assertion of workers' bargaining power. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics said the figures gave some signs that the tighter labour market was leading to a recovery in wage growth. \"Inflation is likely to fall back next year as the impact of the drop in the pound dwindles. What's more, the tightness of the labour market should deliver further rises in nominal wage growth over the coming quarters,\" she said. The pound rose rose against both the dollar and the euro following the positive news on jobs, recovering some of the ground lost on Tuesday, before losing most of those gains.

City and Guilds managing director Kirstie Donnelly said it was \"worrying\" to see the figures \"creep up after months of more positive news\". The Office of National Statistics figures date back to October to December 2001 when 833,000 young people were classified as NEET, some 12.9% of the total age-group. At the end of last year that proportion had fallen to 11.8%. NEET numbers reached from highs of over a million, or more than 16% of the age-group, in 2011, but have fallen consistently since. In England, the government raised the education participation age to 17 in September 2013 and to 18 in September 2015. So young people in England are now expected to stay in full-time education, in an apprenticeship, or in employment with training until they are 18. The UK-wide NEET figures first dropped below the million mark, to 987,000, or 13.5% of the age group in the first quarter of 2014. England-only figures show there were 690,000 NEETs at the end of last year, almost 100,000 fewer than in the last quarter of 2014. This figure is the lowest since 2000 when comparable records began and the number stood at 629,000, says the government. Skills Minister Nick Boles said the figures showed the government was delivering on its commitment to ensure all young people were either earning or learning. \"There is no room for complacency, though, and through our plans to deliver three million new apprenticeships by 2020 and our qualification reforms, we are determined to build on these excellent results,\" said Mr Boles. But campaigners say the figures are still too high . \"More than one in every 10 teenagers is currently locked out of a path to the future,\" said Ms Donnelly.

The development, hours before voting took place, was described by opposition Democratic Front leader Andrija Mandic as \"gross propaganda\" and Serbia's prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, said the timing was strange.

And the streets and underground network of Vienna are kept remarkably clean. But smoky air in cafes and restaurants has been widely tolerated for years. \"Smoking is a sort of culture, especially in Austria,\" Margit Schwed told me as she sat in Cafe Ritter in Vienna, with its gilt chandeliers and marble table tops. \"In the typical Vienna Kaffeehaus you take your coffee and your cigarette. I think people like the flair in the coffee houses.\" Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people: 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more. A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area. Several years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas. Small restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not. Larger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions. The law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced. Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018. \"We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,\" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said. However there were protests from the far-right Freedom Party and from Austria's Chamber of Commerce.

Among them is goalkeeper Hope Solo, who could win a record fourth Olympic title at Rio, and current world player of the year Carli Lloyd. Team GB fielded men's and women's teams at London 2012, with both sides knocked out at the quarter-final stage. The English Football Association had hoped to have both teams in Rio, but they failed to gain support from the other home nations and Fifa was not willing to accept a Great Britain team without players from every one of the home nations. Qualification is also based on tournament results and while England's women would have earned their place by finishing third at last year's World Cup, the men's failure to get past the group stage of the European Under-21 Championships would have denied them. Team GB qualification is based on England's results because the English FA is the national governing body on the BOA. \"I'm really disappointed that these next set of players won't have that opportunity in Rio,\" said former England striker Kelly Smith, who was part of Team GB's 18-strong squad at London. \"It's a great experience and you get to play against the best teams and players from across the world.

Complainants also said it implied that overweight women did not take care of themselves or how they looked. The former Cheryl was shown wearing a baggy shirt and had messy hair, while the current, happier Cheryl had a more polished appearance. Diet Chef said the ad showed the frustration of the former Cheryl, who did not feel able to make a change in her lifestyle or to maintain a controlled diet and so was surprised that she had done so, and the sense of achievement of the later Cheryl. It also said the advert's approach was typical of the \"before and after\" genre commonly used to advertise weight loss products. The ASA said the advert did not give the impression that former Cheryl had neglected her personal appearance and said viewers would be unlikely to find this part of the advert offensive. But it said the character's unhappy demeanour while talking about wearing a bikini appeared disproportionate to concerns about her weight, especially as she did not appear to be particularly overweight. The ASA said the advert \"implied that weight loss was the only solution to her problems\".

But experts warned the plans could harm advert-funded media, as well as platforms such as Facebook and Google. Cookies are small files that download on to a user's device and enable tracking, sometimes to power advertising. Since 2012, EU rules have required websites to tell users what cookies are being placed on their machine. Typically, this meant a pop-up window seeking consent. European Commission vice-president, Andrus Ansip, said it was now proposing simpler rules, \"so that internet users do not have to click on a banner every time they visit a website\". \"This way, people will be more in control of their settings,\" he said.

Also, banners would be scrapped for cookies that do not invade users' privacy, such as those remembering shopping cart history or counting website hits. Last year, many internet companies called for the EU to scrap the so-called \"cookie law\", introduced in 2012. However, the latest proposals could end up damaging online services and frustrate web users, according to a senior executive at a trade body that represents many of the world's biggest internet firms. \"The banners are certainly annoying. The question is whether they come up with something that's better or worse,\" said James Waterworth, vice-president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.

When the US researchers added molecules called microRNAs, it put the brakes on cancer, Nature Cell Biology reports. Although the early tests in a dish look promising, it is unclear whether it will help treat people with cancer. The Mayo Clinic researchers are hopeful that the new mechanism they have found could apply to all types of cancer. It brings together two strands of science - cell adhesion and microRNA (miRNA) biology - that, until now, had not been linked. Scientists had thought adhesion molecules were simply the glue that holds cells together. But then others found they might have signalling roles. The Mayo Clinic work shows adhesion molecules connect cells and signal via miRNAs to control cell growth. If this becomes deregulated it can drive cancer. But replenishing cells with miRNAs can remedy this. Lead researcher Dr Panos Anastasiadis said: \"By administering the affected miRNAs in cancer cells to restore their normal levels, we should be able to re-establish the brakes and restore normal cell function. \"Initial experiments in some aggressive types of cancer are indeed very promising.\" Henry Scowcroft, Cancer Research UK's senior science information manager, said: \"This important study solves a long-standing biological mystery, but we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. \"There's a long way to go before we know whether these findings, in cells grown in a laboratory, will help treat people with cancer.

But the former Wales captain and British and Irish Lions tourist has been disappointed that his country have not been able to beat an All Blacks team in transition following high-profile retirements. After the 2015 World Cup, the All Blacks lost record-breaking flanker and captain Richie McCaw, fly-half Dan Carter and midfield pair Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith. \"There are two schools of thought at the moment in Wales,\" said Williams. \"One, 'yes we've gone toe-to-toe with the All Blacks and played some great rugby'. \"And the other one is, 'well we've failed again' because they are a team in transition.

We didn't have injury worries so I thought this was our opportunity.\" The All Blacks have made five starting changes for the third Test, with coach Steve Hansen hoping the risk will have its rewards. Flanker Elliott Dixon makes his debut at blind-side flanker in place of Jerome Kaino, while George Moala takes over at centre from injured Malakai Fekitoa. Fly-half Beauden Barrett makes only his eighth All Blacks start in 38 appearances as he takes over from Aaron Cruden, who was injured in the second Test. Barrett has scored 26 points, including three tries in four appearances against Wales. Two of those tries came in a 15-point haul as New Zealand beat Wales 34-16 in Cardiff in 2014 in his previous start against Warren Gatland's side. Barrett crossed for his third try against Wales in Wellington last weekend.

{"text": "Rising energy prices pushed inflation to 1.8% in January, a near four-year high and up from 1.1% in December. Eurostat data also showed the jobless rate fell to 9.6% in December, the lowest rate since May 2009. GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. The rise in eurozone inflation last month was driven by an 8.1% jump in energy prices in January compared with the year before. The spike in the rate takes it up to the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%. Some have called for the European Central Bank to further scale back its bond-buying programme. However, the ECB also looks at core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices, in its policy decisions, and this rate remained unchanged at 0.9% in January. In December, the ECB said it would buy bonds worth 60bn euros a month from April. The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended. The stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending. The European Central Bank's key job is to maintain \"price stability\" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%. For the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices. That has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money. So with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off? Not necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow. There are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal. The eurozone's unemployment rate of 9.6% in December was down from 9.7% in November and compares with a rate of 10.5% a year earlier. The countries with the lowest unemployment rates in December were the Czech Republic (3.5%) and Germany (3.9%), while countries with the highest levels of unemployment were Greece (23.0% in October 2016) and Spain (18.4%). Despite the pick-up in economic growth during the final quarter of 2016, across the year as a whole eurozone GDP rose by 1.7%, which was down from 2% in 2015. Analysts also questioned whether the recent improvement could be sustained. \"While recent economic news points to improved growth, we suspect the eurozone may find it difficult to sustain this momentum amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. \"Consequently, we suspect that eurozone GDP growth in 2017 will be no more than 1.6%.

{"text": "The little girl sustained two injuries in 2013 - a bite mark to her face aged nine months, and a fracture to her upper arm when she was 13 months old. A Crown Court judge branded the offences by her 30-year-old father as \"appalling\". He was given a 12-month prison sentence which will be followed by two years on licence upon his release. The 30-year-old man, who lives in the Ards Peninsula, was found guilty of two charges - being cruel to a child and causing her grievous bodily harm. He told the court he could not cope with parenting, and claimed that the more his daughter cried, the more stressed he became. Belfast Crown Court heard that the child's father has Asperger's Syndrome, which the judge accepted may have impacted on how he dealt with stress. However, the judge said that whilst his condition may be relevant to explain some of his behaviour, the offences were serious and as such attracted a custodial sentence. Also appearing in court was the child's mother, who was made the subject of a two-year probation order after she admitted a single charge of child cruelty. The judge said that she failed, as a mother, to protect her child from the risk of harm posed by her partner, given she was aware of the first incident where her daughter's face was injured. Neither the child's mother nor her father can be named in order to protect the identity of the little girl, who the court heard is now living with a family member and is \"thriving.\" The court also heard that the couple broke up sometime between the first and second assault as the father still had access to his daughter. The judge told the 30-year-old: \"Such appalling offences against a helpless and vulnerable baby cannot be treated lightly.\" During sentencing on Friday, it emerged that the father has had no contact with his daughter since the second assault and is unlikely to do so, while the child's mother has limited access.", "summary": "A County Antrim father who assaulted his baby daughter has been jailed.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary makes up the county it happened in"], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 2873}

Numbers of manx shearwaters and storm petrels had declined by 25% on St Agnes and Gugh in 25 years. But colonies are recovering thanks to the rat eradication measures. Poison placed in an agricultural pipe was positioned in 1,000 locations on the islands in order to kill the vermin. According to international protocols, the islands could not be officially declared rat-free for two years after the last sign of rat was detected - making them officially free of the rodent on 13 February. Jaclyn Pearson, from the RSPB Isles of Scilly seabird recovery project, said the seabird population was already starting to recover. \"Straight away we saw results,\" she said. \"The baiting was done in winter 2013, and in September 2014 we had 10 Manx Shearwater chicks.

{"text": "The framework agreement, struck after intensive talks, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief. Iran and the six world powers involved must now finalise the deal. Iranians have been celebrating in the streets but Israel says the deal threatens its survival. \"This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb,\" the US President said in a statement after the deal was announced. \"If Iran cheats, the world will know it,\" he said, adding that the agreement was based not on trust but on \"unprecedented verification\". He said that if the deal is finalised, \"we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully\". According to \"parameters\" of the agreement published by the US state department, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium into a bomb by more than two-thirds. It also has to redesign a power plant so it cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium, be subject to regular inspections, and agree not to enrich uranium over 3.67% - far less than is required to make a nuclear bomb - for at least 15 years. \"There's new state of the art technology that will be used,\" US Secretary of State John Kerry told the BBC. \"We will have tracking of their uranium from the cradle to the grave.\" There's been celebration through the night across Iran and a hero's welcome for Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. But the deal he's brought home has been dismissed by hardliners who say Iran surrendered too much in exchange for too little. John Kerry also faces a mix of support and scepticism in the US Congress. The loudest condemnation has come from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, who insists this deal doesn't block but helps Iran build a nuclear bomb. As hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June. But, if negotiators do it, it will be a victory for diplomacy which, they believe will make the world a much safer place. A deal that buys time . The framework agreement was announced by the European Union and Iran after eight days of intense negotiations in the Swiss city of Lausanne. Western powers have long distrusted Iran's assertions that its nuclear programme is peaceful. The talks at Lausanne's Beau-Rivage Palace hotel between Iran and the so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - continued beyond the original, self-imposed deadline of 31 March. The Iranian foreign minister, Javid Zarif, called it a \"win-win outcome\", but warned: \"We have taken a major step, but are still some way away from where we want to be.\" The parties have set a deadline of 30 June to reach a comprehensive pact, but these negotiations are expected to be tougher than those that led to the framework agreement. Even so, there was jubilation overnight on the streets of Tehran. If the deal is implemented it should mean the eventual lifting of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Unusually, the US President's speech was aired live on Iranian state television, with some Iranians taking \"selfies\" with Mr Obama as a backdrop. There was anger though from Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of Iran and told President Obama the deal threatened the survival of Israel. The Israeli prime minister said it would \"increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war\", according to his spokesman. In the US, the deal has been criticised by members of Congress who want US lawmakers to have the right to review any final agreement.

{"text": "The \u00a3300m re-signalling project affected Cardiff and Valley line services and mainline travel between Newport and Bridgend from Christmas Eve until 2 January. Passengers experienced \"severe delays\" and cancellations from Thursday after engineering works over ran. Network Rail said the lines have now been handed back to rail operators. The project also saw a new platform eight open at Cardiff Central station on Monday - which will allow more trains to arrive at the station at any one time. It has been designed to ease congestion and will be used by passengers travelling on lines to Penarth, Barry Island and destinations in the Vale of Glamorgan. The positive effects were already being felt by commuters on Tuesday. Peter Clarke, who lives near Reading but stays in south Wales during the week while working in Cardiff, even missed work over the festive period as he was worried about the effects of rail alterations. The works on top of weekday train delays meant he \"couldn't face it\" and he lost wages. He described the situation frustrated passengers faced before platform eight opened - sitting on a static train waiting for a platform to become free. Mr Clarke said: \"If I'm staying in a hotel in the valleys, it is not too bad to Queen Street. But then to central, a three or four minute journey can take 15 to 20 minutes, just sat between the stations. \"It is so frustrating, it is quicker to get off at Queen Street and walk.\" He said the situation is exacerbated if a train is late, with trains then queuing to get on to one of the few available platforms. But with platform eight open, allowing more to arrive at central at the same time, he said he had a \"good experience\" on Tuesday. Jacob Hewlett, 24, has been left frustrated by late trains, but believes the situation will now improve. He said: \"I travel on the Ebbw Valley line and there are always plenty of delays - 20 or 30 minutes into Cardiff. \"It is just really annoying when you have another 10 or 15 minutes on top of that after a hard day's work. An extra line should make my trip to work an awful lot easier.\" Ryan Smith is also confident the work will improve train speeds, but wants to see more work done nearer his home. The line to Treherbert turns to a single track north of Porth, which means only one train can travel on it at a time. He wants to see another put in to speed up the service near the end of the line. For Louis Curtis from Penarth, securing investment to improve the front of the station is just as important as improvements inside. He described the entrance as \"a bit grotty\", adding: \"Before you had the bus station outside, which wasn't that nice. \"Now, it's been knocked down and work is going on, it doesn't give a good impression of the city. \"Hopefully it will be better when everything is done, but there should be more green spaces.\" Natasha Higgitt, 20, uses the line to Cross Keys mid-morning on weekdays and said it is fine at that time, but believes the new platform will improve the situation at rush hour.

An average price increase of 2.3% was introduced on Monday covering regulated fares, including season tickets, and unregulated, such as off-peak tickets. The UK government said it was delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for more than a century. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales outside Cardiff Central station, Owen Herbert from the RMT union said the rise in fares was an \"absolutely disgrace\" and was not reflected in the services. \"The services have been depleted while fares have been going through the roof,\" he said.

It's most often associated with John Maynard Keynes, the influential British economist who urged public spending to stimulate a weak economy. Newspapers also made the comparison during the presidency of Herbert Hoover, who was in office during the Wall Street Crash. Early Thursday morning, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Twitter account struck back, noting: \"'Pump priming' has been used to refer to government investment expenditures since at least 1933.\" The Oxford English Dictionary identifies the phrase used in a business context even earlier, quoting a 1916 edition of Everybody's Mag: \"When the waters of business are stagnant, gentlemen, it becomes necessary, if I may say so, to prime the pump.\" The White House press office did not respond to an email seeking clarification on Mr Trump's comments. But even Mr Trump has a longer history with the expression.

{"text": "BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme discovered 22 profiles belonging to men convicted of child sex offences, which included grooming a child on Facebook and attempting to meet her for sex. Six of the accounts remained live three weeks after the BBC reported them. Facebook's UK policy director Simon Milner said the company was effective in dealing with the issue. He said he appreciated the BBC bringing the pages to light but said Facebook worked proactively to search out behaviour that should not be happening on the site. According to the platform's own rules, convicted sex offenders are not allowed to use the social media network. Among the profiles uncovered was one belonging to Bruce Cordwell, 20, who groomed 15-year-old Kayleigh Haywood through Facebook and Whatsapp just days before she was raped and murdered by another man, Stephen Beadman, in November 2015. \"It's absolutely vile,\" said Stephanie Haywood, Kayleigh's mother, when she was shown Cordwell's page. Kayleigh, from Measham, Leicestershire, was contacted by 28-year-old Luke Harlow on Facebook in 2015 and the pair exchanged more than 2,600 messages during a two-week period. After Harlow convinced art enthusiast Kayleigh he was her boyfriend, she agreed to stay over at his flat in Ibstock. The following night, his neighbour Stephen Beadman came round to the flat and later raped and murdered the teenager before dumping her body in a hedgerow. Beadman was jailed for 35 years for murder, rape and false imprisonment, and Harlow received a 12-year sentence for meeting a child following sexual grooming, sexual activity with a child and false imprisonment. But while detectives were investigating the case, they discovered Cordwell, then 19, had also been sexually grooming Kayleigh. In February, he was jailed for three years and seven months after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence. Stephanie, a mother-of-eight, said convicted child sex offenders who remained on social media posed a huge risk. \"There is a risk they could do what they've done again, or worse,\" she said. \"I say, 'Once a groomer always a groomer.' \"Once they've been inside for whatever they've done, I think they should remove it. I think it's horrible.\" By comparing police mug shots and media coverage of child sex abuse cases and cross-referencing them with the details on Facebook, File on 4 tracked down accounts belonging to 22 convicted offenders. Facebook has a rule that forbids convicted sex offenders from using its site and has a portal for people to report pages belonging to offenders. The portal requires people to supply a link to the offender's page and provide evidence of their offending, which could be a link to a media report of the court case. Facebook then checks on the offenders with the police before removing them from the site. When the BBC reported the 22 pages it had found, most were removed within 48 hours - but six remained live three weeks after the BBC reported them. Facebook said it was waiting for confirmation from police that the final six were convicted offenders before it could remove the pages. In response to File on 4's findings Facebook's UK policy director Simon Milner, said: \"We appreciate you did that, we appreciate it when anybody reports to us things that are happening on Facebook that shouldn't be. \"Our teams that focus on this work with the relevant local police force to get authorisation from them and it works.\" Mr Milner said Facebook worked proactively to search out behaviour that should not be happening on the site. He added: \"We've found in terms of our working relationship with law enforcement in this country and elsewhere they think we are amongst the most effective companies in dealing with this issue and we actually do have the right kind of arrangements in place.\" Meanwhile, exclusive figures obtained by File on 4 through Freedom of Information requests revealed the most popular social media platforms had been linked to more than 7,000 reports of child sex crimes over the past three years. Figures from 22 police forces revealed 7,162 child sex offences had been recorded between 2014-15 and 2016-17, with a 44% increase recorded over the three-year period. The offences included rape, sexual activity with a child and child sexual grooming involving children as young as three years old.

{"text": "Ahead of the vote, here are seven things you need to know about the West African country - once hailed as a model of stability. The economy has boomed in recent years and Ivory Coast is the world's biggest exporter of cocoa, producing around 40% of the planet's beans used to manufacture chocolate. But this year, it also overtook India as the leading exporter of cashew nuts. Cocoa transformed Ivory Coast into the \"Paris of Africa\" as it was called in the 1970s and 1980s, until a slump in cocoa prices dampened the \"Ivorian miracle\". President Alassane Ouattara, who took office in May 2011, wanted to diversify the economy. Agriculture is still the backbone, but it includes bananas, rubber and palm oil too. The last elections in 2010 sparked five months of violence when former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down. More than 3,000 people were killed in some of the most brutal violence the country has ever seen. President Ouattara has been accused of one-sided justice after hundreds of Mr Gbagbo's supporters were imprisoned but very few from his side were even arrested - despite the UN and international human rights organisations saying both sides committed atrocities. No more \"nids de poules\" on the country's major roads. The French call potholes \"chicken nests\". The government says it has built 1,000km (620 miles) of new roads since it has been in power and rehabilitated another 20,000km throughout Ivory Coast. It is promising to build 1,200km more if re-elected. There were 10, now there are seven. A former finance minister, Mamadou Koulibaly, and former foreign minister, Amara Essy, dropped out saying the elections would not be free and fair. The latest, former prime minister Charles Konan Banny, pulled out on Friday, with the same complaint. That leaves another former prime minister - Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of Laurent Gbagbo's former party - as Mr Ouattara's main rival. Mr Ouattara is the eldest at 73, while independent candidate Claire Jacqueline Kouangoua, one of only two women running, is the youngest at 44. Mr Affi N'Guessan, the main opposition candidate, is using the same slogan that France's Francois Hollande did in his last campaign , \"Le changement maintenant\", meaning \"Change now\", which is ironic considering how unpopular Mr Hollande is now in France. Mr Ouattara, known to his supporters as \"Ado\" because of his initials, has chosen to use \"Avec Ado, reussir ensemble\", meaning \"With Ado, succeed together\". This is also interesting because one of the main criticisms of President Ouattara has been his lack of focus on reconciliation since the crisis. The campaign theme of \"togetherness\" is clearly supposed to address this. Music has always played a role in Ivory Coast politics. Alpha Blondy, the country's undisputed king of reggae, began singing about war and fighting in the country as early as 1998. In 2010, he openly backed former President Laurent Gbagbo, giving a free concert in Abidjan. His main reggae rival, Tiken Jah Fakoly who sang anti-Gbagbo songs, had to go into exile and has decided to stay in Mali. And this election is no different when it comes to music and the main candidates have their songs. Mr N'Guessan's talks about \"the fighters\" being \"tired\" and how they were all the \"victims of the political violence\" but Affi N'Guessan is their man. Mr Ouattara's focuses instead on what the government has done for the economy, singing: \"With Ado, Ivory Coast wins.\" The Elephants are the pride of Ivory Coast, and while football is a game and has nothing to do with politics, we all know that's not true. Didier Drogba has been attributed with single-handedly putting an end to violence that was raging in the country in 2005 when he fell to his knees on national television and asked fighters to lay down their arms. A week later they did. This year Drogba, along with his former teammates and other international Ivorian sport stars, like sprinter Murielle Ahoure, have a new message for voters. \"Election c pas gnaga\".

{"text": "The aim is to help people save money by encouraging them to change their banks, especially if they are likely to go overdrawn. The plans come from the Competition and Markets Authority, which has the power to enforce its proposals. They are the result of its two-year investigation. The big idea is that something must be done to break the inertia of the UK banking public. Just 3% of individuals and 4% of businesses switch their banks in any one year. The CMA has already come to the conclusion that there is not enough competition to pressurise the banks into offering significantly better or cheaper services than their rivals. In effect the big five banks - RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander - plus the Nationwide building society have their own huge, but largely captive, markets. So the aim is to make it easier for people to switch banks and accounts, and to encourage them to save money by finding a better deal. \"The older and larger banks, which still account for the large majority of the retail banking market, do not have to work hard enough to win and retain customers and it is difficult for new and smaller providers to attract customers,\" the CMA says. The other big issue is one that has dogged the industry and its customers for many years - the ability of banks to charge more or less what they like if you go overdrawn without permission. In 2009, the Office of Fair Trading (now part of the CMA) failed completely in a legal challenge which would have overthrown the right of banks to set their own charges as they saw fit. Now the CMA is ordering the banks to set their own monthly cash limits - a monthly maximum charge - on just how much they can charge if you go into an unauthorised overdraft - going into the red without asking your bank in advance. Of course that doesn't go as far as a regulator being allowed to set a monthly limit on overdraft fees and charges. But the fact there will be some sort of stated cash limit will make things clearer. \"Many personal customers, in particular overdraft users, could make significant savings by switching to a different current account,\" says the CMA. That particular change should happen by September next year. To encourage customers to switch or shop around, the CMA is ordering the banking industry to embrace the idea of Open Banking. That means the financial technology industry is being invited to develop a computer application which will let bank customers run all their bank accounts, including moving money between them, even if they have several accounts spread around different banks. At the moment the increasingly popular bank apps, which are issued by banks to their own customers for use on mobile phones, operate that bank's accounts only. This new, all-purpose, banking app should be able, the CMA says, to let customers upload all their banking details so that \"authorised intermediaries\", such as price comparison services, will be able to tell them where the best accounts and services are to suit the way they typically save and spend. The CMA hopes that this will encourage customers to move money around, either to avoid upcoming overdraft charges, or to gain higher interest on more generous accounts. There are quite a few other proposals, for instance: . The CMA has spent the past two years investigating the banking industry. Its final report, published today, is just the latest in a very long line of official inquiries into the banking industry that have been held over the past 20 years or so. But now the CMA's plans have been finalised and published, they have various implementation dates ranging from the beginning of 2017 to the autumn of 2018.", "summary": "The UK's big five banks are being ordered by the competition regulator to do two things.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1538}
{"text": "Mr Abdel Fattah had been sentenced to 15 years in jail for violating a strict anti-protest law. He is currently facing a retrial in the case. Mr Abdel Fattah gained fame during the 2011 uprising against the then-President, Hosni Mubarak. His arrest had heightened fears of a crackdown on dissent in Egypt. Correspondents say the 15-year sentence was one of the harshest ever awarded to a non-Islamist activist in the country. Mr Abdel Fattah had been charged with assaulting a policeman at an illegal protest. He was sentenced in June, along with 24 others, but was not allowed to be in court for the verdict. The same judges presided over his retrial, prompting Mr Abdel Fattah to complain that he had \"no confidence\" in them. A lawyer for Mr Abdel Fattah, Mohammed Abdel-Aziz, said on Monday that the judge presiding over the retrial had stepped down at the request of the defence team. He said the judge had also ordered an investigation into the prosecutor's use of Mr Abdul Fattah's personal videos, \"which violated the accused's privacy\". At a previous hearing, the prosecutor had shown videos of family celebrations which had no link to the case, Mr Abdel-Aziz told AFP news agency. The retrial will resume when a new judge is assigned to the case. Mr Abdel Fattah is expected to leave prison on Tuesday.

{"text": "The speech built on her article in The Times on Monday and is important for a number of reasons - not least its attempt to marry a general and widespread disillusion among the public that the economy \"is not working for them\" with a sense that the Conservative Party's driving philosophy is about more than free markets. The first of these is straight from the playbook of Mr Miliband; the second is from Lady Thatcher. Here's Mr Miliband at the time of the 2011 Labour Party conference where he announced plans to rein in \"excessive pay\". \"This is not an anti-business message, this is an anti-business as usual message,\" he told the Today programme. And here's Mrs May today, on her plans to tackle the \"unhealthy and growing gap\" between what she deliberately describes as \"bosses\" and \"workers\". \"It is not anti-business to suggest that big business needs to change,\" she said. Now, of course Mrs May would be likely to splutter into her morning cup of tea if there was any suggestion that Mr Miliband was guiding her politically. As she said in her speech this morning, the Home Secretary believes that Labour's approach to \"equality\" holds people back. And she insisted the Conservatives remained the party of enterprise. But Mrs May's pledges to put worker representatives on company boards (as well as \"consumers\"), to make shareholder votes on executive remuneration binding, to oblige companies to publish data on the pay multiple between a company's chief executive and the pay of the average worker, to have a \"proper industrial strategy\" that could be used to block takeovers such as Pfizer's attempt to buy AstraZeneca - all are certainly a substantial attempt to build the broadest of Tory tents. Further, they are a deliberate economic pitch for the centre ground of politics, to a level of detail many will be surprised by. Anyone who thought that a Conservative-led administration under Mrs May would not be interventionist when it comes to economic and business policy will certainly have to reconsider. Mrs May even had some words for policy makers at the Bank of England, saying that ultra-low interest rates had helped home owners over those struggling to clamber on the housing ladder. So, where does Lady Thatcher fit in? Rather more subtly, but still distinctly, in the line: \"We don't just believe in markets, but in communities.\" Lady Thatcher was clear on her distrust of \"big state\" solutions and spoke regularly of communities of people, even \"society\" despite the oft-quoted line that there was \"no such thing\". She said that people should be allowed to get on and should prosper, as long as they played by the rules. Mrs May appears to be echoing the sentiment, replacing the \"big state\" with \"big business\" and \"vested interests\". She vowed to take them on, tying a reformist line directly from Robert Peel to Joseph Chamberlain to Lady Thatcher. Mrs May also spoke of \"leading on behalf of the people\". Many argue that Brexit uncertainty will make the fortunes of the UK economy over the coming months and years difficult to forecast. Mrs May, launching herself as the UK's next prime minister, appears to want to be tested on whether that economy is seen as working for everyone.", "summary": "Home Secretary Theresa May's speech to the Conservative conference this morning is an important moment for the Conservative Party.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary makes up May's first name", "The summary states that the speech was given at the Conservative conference, but the text does not mention that the speech took place at the Conservative conference."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 1135}

Durham Crown Court heard McKerry, of Coundon, near Bishop Auckland, had earlier admitted attempted robbery. McKerry, whose face was hidden by a scarf and hood, brandished the weapon as he ordered shop assistant Andrea Brighty to fill a bag with money from the till, the court heard. But Mr Dhillon ran from a back office, grabbed McKerry from behind and wrestled him to the floor. The court heard McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy because of his repeated spells in prison, had been arrested more than 80 times. He was told he must serve an extended four-year licence period after he is released. The court was told McKerry started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. Dramatic CCTV footage from the shop showed the masked McKerry waving an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty. But he did not see Mr Dhillon's rugby tackle, which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling.

{"text": "Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said rock was dug away from cliffs near Bearreraig Bay in an apparent organised search for valuable specimens. The agency said Skye was known as Scotland's \"Dinosaur Isle\" because of its important fossil records. SNH has appealed for witnesses to contact the police. Skye is a key dinosaur fossil site in Scotland. Bearreraig Bay, north of Portree, is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A crowbar is suspected to have been used to prise away some of the rock. Dinosaur footprints may also have been removed from Valtos on Skye, SNH said. Evidence gathered at Valtos has been used by palaeontologists to explain what has been called the Dino Stampede in Australia, an incident where a group of dinosaurs were pursued by a predator. SNH said the Bearreraig Bay dig had been done without the landowner's permission or the consent of SNH, which manages the SSSI. Dr Colin MacFadyen, SNH's geologist, also said the actions went against guidelines in the Scottish Fossil Code. The codes does allow for the use of mechanical diggers, rock saws and even explosives for extracting fossils, but only when it was to the benefit of palaeontological research. Dr MacFadyen said: \"Fossil collecting is important for scientific and educational purposes, and is a popular hobby. \"It is better for fossils that fall from cliffs to be found, collected and enjoyed rather than be eroded and washed away by the tide. \"However, speeding up the process by large scale rock removal as in this alarming case is irresponsible and illegal, and also potentially dangerous to people as the cliff faces are undermined and destabilised.\" Dr MacFadyen said permission to remove material from the SSSI would have been needed from SNH, but it had not been sought. He said fossil-rich rock had been damaged at the Bearreraig Bay site. Dr Neil Clark, of University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, has described Skye as one of the world's most important palaeontology sites. Its standing is underlined by the number of finds from the Middle Jurassic, about 170 million years ago. Dr Clark told the BBC News Scotland website: \"This is quite a shock. It is not something I have heard of happening before. \"Without knowing exactly where the damage is I can't say what they were after.

The sender has not been identified, but researchers have found a reference to a US television programme in Duqu's code. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, reported that the country's cyber defence unit was taking steps to combat the infection. \"The software to control the virus has been developed and made available to organisations and corporations,\" Brigadier General Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran's civil defence body, is quoted as saying. \"All the organisations and centres that could be susceptible to being contaminated are being controlled.\" Mr Jalali said a \"final report\" into which organisations had been targeted was still being worked on. Last year the Iranian government accused the West of trying to disrupt its nuclear facilities using the Stuxnet worm computer attack. Then in April 2011 officials said the country's facilities had been targeted by a second piece of malware dubbed \"Stars\". Officials now describe the Duqu attack as the \"third virus\" to hit Iran. The computer security specialist Kaspersky Lab said it believed that \"Stars\" was a keylogging program that may have been part of the same attack that installed Duqu. Keylogging programs are able to collect information about a computer system, take screenshots, search for files and capture passwords. The firm also provided more detail about how Duqu worked based on its analysis of other targets. It said another unidentified company received an email from an individual identifying himself as Mr B Jason who requested a joint business venture. The firm believed this was a reference to the Jason Bourne books and spy movies. The recipient was asked to open a Microsoft Word attachment that referenced the targeted company's name in its title, and thus did not appear to be spam. It said that for every victim a separate set of attack files was created using a different control server. The firm said this happened at least 12 times. When the addressee opened the file the malware became active through a Truetype font exploit, but did nothing until it detected that there had been no keyboard or mouse activity for ten minutes. Kaspersky Lab said the font was called Dexter Regular and its creators were identified as Showtime Inc. \"This is another prank pulled by the Duqu authors, since Showtime Inc is the cable broadcasting company behind the TV series Dexter, about a CSI doctor who happens also to be a serial killer,\" the report said. The firm said the exploit then loaded a driver onto the system. Analysis of the driver suggested it was compiled as long ago as August 2007. \"If this information is correct, then the authors of Duqu must have been working on this project for over four years,\" the report said. The firm said the driver then began a process that led to the Duqu trojan being installed allowing the attackers to introduce new modules, infect other networked computers, and collect information. The company said efforts to identify the attackers have been complicated by the fact that the suspects appear to have deactivated several of the control servers thought to have been involved in the attacks.", "summary": "Iranian officials have confirmed that the country has been hit by malware known as Duqu.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1732}

It recommended the Scottish government and NHS boards agree minimum safe staffing levels for all professions in hospitals. The Scottish government said NHS staffing was at its highest-ever level. The academy set up a working group to look at how the health service could learn from past failures. It followed three previous reports into serious failings of care in the Scottish health service. They looked at problems of staffing and leadership at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI); above-average mortality rates at NHS Lanarkshire; and the worst-ever outbreak of C-difficile infection, at Vale of Leven Hospital. The academy's report, Learning from Serious Failings in Care, identified key issues to be addressed, including: . The working group was chaired by Prof Alan Paterson of Strathclyde University and involved senior experts from the Royal Colleges in Scotland. Prof Paterson said: \"It is clear that serious failings in team working between clinical staff and NHS management played a significant role in the failings in care identified. \"These failings are deep-rooted and systemic. They must not be ignored if we are to learn from them and to prevent repetition. \"It is also clear that a combination of factors led to some appalling failings in care, a loss of basic compassion and the prioritisation of inappropriate targets over patient care. In addition, leadership and accountability were all too often sadly lacking and bullying endemic. \"While there have been responses to the individual published reports of inquiries and reviews into failings in care, there is little evidence to suggest that we are tackling the underlying systemic failings which exist.\" The report recommended that hospital staffing levels should be based on \"best evidence\". It said priority should be given to developing minimum safe staffing for acute medicine and medicine for the elderly wards. Among its 20 recommendations was a suggestion that there should be less reliance on locum and agency staff, and a call for quality of care to be put ahead of meeting targets, . It also raised concerns about staff sickness, saying this could be an indication of deteriorating morale and should be used as \"an early warning system\". Royal College of Nursing Scotland Director Theresa Fyffe said: \"These are hard-hitting recommendations and will make uncomfortable reading for many managers and leaders in our health service.\" She added: \"Too often, failures in care are down to unsafe staffing levels. We know that quality of care is inextricably linked to having the right number of suitably skilled staff in the right place at the right time, with the right balance between registered nurses and unregistered staff. \"Having appropriately trained and experienced staff must be a priority for all health boards if they are to deliver safe, high quality care to patients.\" The Scottish government's national clinical director for healthcare quality, Prof Jason Leitch, said: \"We are committed to driving up standards in our NHS which is why we have led the way in responding to the reports detailed in the Scottish Academy's report. \"We are absolutely clear about the value we place on staff and the safe and effective service they deliver to patients. \"We currently have the highest staffing levels across our NHS than ever before, with increases under this government of over 1,300 more consultants, and 2,300 more qualified nurses and midwives.\" Prof Leitch added: \"We are constantly striving to further improve health care in Scotland and will review the recommendations within this report and take forward any learning that will benefit NHS Scotland, either as part of the follow up work to the Vale of Leven, Grampian and Lanarkshire reviews.\"", "summary": "A report into serious failings of care in Scotland's hospitals has highlighted \"deep-rooted and systemic\" problems.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2914}

{"text": "The report said cutting the higher rate from 40% to 30% would bring in about \u00a3500m extra a year after 10 years. The higher rate is currently paid on annual taxable income of between \u00a343,001 and \u00a3150,000. Control over income tax is due to be split between UK and Welsh ministers, once an agreement can be reached. The report, by Prof James Foreman-Peck and Dr Peng Zhou, assumed no change in England's tax rates. Although they predicted tax income in Wales could fall in the first three years after a cut, the authors said receipts should rise in the longer term as high earners find it worthwhile to move from England. \"The encouragement to some households to immigrate, increasing Welsh taxable income, is greater than the revenue lost from the reduction in the rate\", the report said. For the top earners with income of more than \u00a3150,000 a year - about one in 100 UK residents - a cut in the additional 45% rate should also boost tax income in Wales, it added.

{"text": "Government plans would give applicants a right to complain to an employment tribunal if they believed they had suffered discrimination. Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to create \"a culture of openness\" where staff feel they can speak up about patient safety. Barrister Sir Robert Francis recommended the measure after a public inquiry into Stafford Hospital deaths. Protecting NHS whistleblowers was a key recommendation from the inquiry into the scandal, which resulted in the trust that ran Stafford Hospital being fined \u00c2\u00a3500,000 for \"basic\" blunders linked to the deaths of four patients. Sir Robert, the inquiry chairman, warned that staff often faced bullying and isolation if they tried to speak out and that staff struggled to find new jobs in the NHS. Under the UK-wide plans, applicants for an NHS job would have the right to complain to an employment tribunal if they had been discriminated against because they had previously raised concerns about the safety of patients. Applicants would also have the right to bring a claim in court in order to prevent discriminatory conduct. And the draft guidelines, which are out for consultation, say that discrimination of an applicant by an NHS worker should be treated like discrimination by the NHS body itself. Health Secretary Mr Hunt said: \"Today we move another step closer to creating a culture of openness in the NHS, where people who have the courage to speak up about patient safety concerns are listened to, not vilified.\" He said the changes would ensure \"staff feel they are protected with the law on their side\". There has been a growing focus on patient safety since Sir Robert's inquiry in 2013. One of the main findings of that report was that people within the NHS had known about the poor levels of care at the hospital, but did not raise the alarm. Since then, a number of initiatives have been launched to improve safety. In 2015, the government introduced plans to appoint guardians to support staff who wanted to speak up about concerns over patient safety. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, said the plans were modest, but a \"welcome move in the right direction\". \"It is clearly unfair that staff who have been forced to become 'whistleblowers' should be discriminated against when they seek alternative jobs. \"However, this is a symptom of a much deeper cultural problem in the NHS which will not be solved with tinkering with rules here and there. \"So far we have not seen a joined-up approach to supporting and protecting staff from unfair treatment when they try to do the right thing and end up having to be whistleblowers.\" Mr Walsh said many NHS trusts had still not appointed guardians, as recommended by the Stafford Hospital inquiry.

The SDF did not mention any plan to take Raqqa, the de facto capital of the \"caliphate\" proclaimed by IS in 2014. The alliance, which is dominated by the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia, has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition over the past two years, leading the fight against IS on the ground in northern Syria. With the help of US airpower, it has taken control of about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles) of territory, including a 400km (250 mile) stretch along the Turkish border. On Tuesday, SDF fighters were seen moving south from Tal Abyad near the Turkish border towards Ain Issa, a town about 60km (37 miles) north-west of Raqqa, according to UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Clashes were reported nearby, it added. SDF commander Rojda Felat wrote on Twitter that the goal of the new offensive was to \"liberate northern Raqqa\" and those living under IS \"oppression\". \"The campaign is aimed at repelling terrorist attacks on Shaddadi, Tal Abyad and Kobane, ensuring the security of our people,\" she added. An SDF source told the Kurdish news agency, Rudaw, that fighters would be \"advancing to the villages of Big Fatiseh, Small Fatiseh and Tishi, in order to clear them of [IS] militants first\". BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville says IS fighters are digging in, ready for the assault. As well as defensive placements in Raqqa, they have constructed an extensive network of tunnels, he adds. A Baghdad-based spokesman for the US-led coalition, Col Steve Warren, said the SDF operation was aimed at \"putting pressure on Raqqa\", but not taking the city. The SDF fighters had so far met little resistance, he added. The anti-IS activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), reported that there had been air strikes on IS positions north of Raqqa on Tuesday, and that intense fighting had erupted around the village of Heisha. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said that Moscow was ready to co-ordinate with the SDF and the US on the offensive. The SDF's announcement followed a meeting between officials in the alliance and a top US commander in northern Syria on Saturday. Gen Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, made the secret trip to check on the 200 US military personnel who were advising the SDF on the ground. The US wants to increase the number of Arab fighters in the SDF, which currently consists of at least 25,000 Kurds and between 5,000 and 6,000 Arabs, before trying to retake Raqqa. Col Warren said about 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters were inside Raqqa. IS seized the city in August 2013, five months after it became the first Syrian provincial capital to fall to rebel forces seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

{"text": "Phillip Smith, 40, was arrested in a hostel in Rio de Janeiro by Brazilian police. He is expected to be extradited or deported. Smith used a passport in his birth name, Phillip Traynor, to fly to Chile and then go to Brazil on 6 November. He escaped while on a three-day release from a prison south of Auckland. Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 after he murdered the father of a 13-year-old boy he had sexually abused between 1992 and 1995. The family had moved house but he had tracked the boy to their new home in Wellington in December 1995. He repeatedly stabbed the father, killing him. The boy managed to escaped and raise the alarm. The victim, who is now 30, told New Zealand's Fairfax media after news of Smith's capture, that he could now stop sleeping with a knife under his pillow. \"It's great news, it's excellent,\" he said from his new home in Australia. \"[I feel] relief, a bit of peace of mind that I can carry on with my life without having that fear over my shoulder.\" Smith's escape has thrown Corrections and various other government agencies into controversy. It has led to calls for an overhaul of short-term prison release and the monitoring of high-risk offenders. In an email Smith sent to Radio New Zealand he said he had planned the escape by running a criminal check on his birth name and discovering that it had not been red-flagged. \"My only anxiety was that somebody that knew me might happen to be at the airport at the same time to identify me,'' he wrote, according to Radio NZ. He also said he had been able to fund the escape with money from various businesses he had run from prison. Smith said he chose Brazil because he thought it would be more difficult to extradite him if he was caught, as the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty. He was arrested after a member of the public in Rio De Janeiro recognised him from images being circulated in hostels and tipped off police. Smith appeared in court after his arrest and has been remanded in custody for 60 days. New Zealand Police Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett said in a press conference on Thursday that it was a relief to have Smith back in custody. He would not, however, say how long he expected Smith to remain in Brazil. \"New Zealand will bring him back as soon as possible but we are reliant on the Brazilian justice system to process and deal with the situation,\" Mr Pannett said. Criminal Bar Association President Tony Bouchier said police needed to be more thorough when checking the names of criminals. \"There's got to be a far more robust process gone through when police are entering people's names into their systems and starting somebody off with a criminal record,\" he told Radio NZ.

On three separate dates, Mr Warren said a Volvo was seen near Mr Findlay's home - including driving away from the crime scene on the day of the alleged attack, two minutes after Mr Burns had been detained. The detective described it in court as \"yellow or gold\". The jury had already heard that Alexander Porter had a gold-coloured Volvo S40 in 2015. On the 28th January Police Scotland executed a search warrant at the home of Alexander Porter, and detained him. During subsequent questioning, the accused replied \"no comment\" to all questions put to him. Under cross-examination by Susan Duff, defence counsel for Mr Porter, Mr Warren said that 16.5 hours of CCTV footage was examined. But neither the registration number or actual colour of the Volvo was identifiable, nor was the number of occupants in the car. Susan Duff also queried the officer's assertion that he knew the Jordanhill area of the city well, pointing out he had called Woodend Drive \"Woodend Road\". During the search of Mr Porter's flat, Mr Warren said 16 items were retrieved from kitchen drawers - none of which was a knife.

Andy Robinson, editor of Computer and Videogames, said that three decades on, the awards still \"represent the voice of gamers worldwide\". \"We've revamped the categories to reflect the diversity of modern gaming and also added the inaugural Lifetime Achievement award, which has made this year's ceremony the most thrilling for us yet,\" he said.

Ms Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban after campaigning for education for girls in Pakistan, has been raising awareness of the lack of education for Syrian refugees. A growing number of Syrian girls are already teenage brides, or working in farms and factories, our chief international correspondent reports from the Jordanian capital, Amman. Major donors are under pressure from Syria's neighbouring countries to provide substantial long-term support if they wish to convince Syrian families to stay in the region instead of heading to Europe. \"It's time for the world to match their commitment to get every Syrian child back in school,\" Malala Yousafzai told me in an email. The 18 year-old campaigner for children's rights will be attending the London Conference with 17-year-old Syrian education activist Muzoon Almellehan, whose family recently settled in the UK. \"My generation is not lost,\" she insists. But the longer Syrian children stay out school, the greater the risk they will not return. British officials say it is not a realistic goal to get them back in class by the end of the next academic year. But they are still pushing hard. UK International Development Secretary Justine Greening told me: \"We must ensure Syria's children do not become a lost generation.\" According to the report by Ms Yousafzai's's charitable fund, donors have provided only 37% of the money needed to supply resources such as school places and teachers. It says $1.4bn (\u00c2\u00a31bn) a year is urgently needed to plug the gap.

That is more than a third higher than the components used in Samsung and Apple's latest flagship phones. Customer surveys have repeatedly highlighted a desire for improved battery life at the top of shopper's most wished for smartphone features. But until now, batteries of this size have been more commonly found in tablets rather than 5.5in (14cm)-screened phones. \"People are constantly engaged with their screens and the screen uses the most power,\" explained Ben Wood from the tech consultancy CCS Insight. \"And the biggest challenge right now is that people are also consuming more video content, thanks to the spread of 4G networks, meaning phone battery life is really getting hammered. \"With the bigger brands people are willing to accept some trade-offs for the phones to appear as slim and slick as possible. \"But everyone else is looking for a way of trying to differentiate their devices.

Both figures are based on the use of a 2G network, which is less energy-intensive than a 3G or 4G connection. Taiwan's Acer has yet to provide a comparable figure for its Liquid X2, which is also unusual for supporting up to three Sim cards at once. \"Following market feedback, we know that battery life is a priority for our customers,\" ST Liew, president of Acer's smartphone business division, told the BBC. \"The 4,000mAh battery is perfect for frequent travellers as it eliminates concerns regarding power, allowing users to be constantly connected whilst on-the-go without the need to carry a charger on a daily basis.\" The firms are not the first to use bigger lithium-ion batteries to make their phones stand out. Last year Motorola developed the Moto Maxx, ahead of its takeover by Lenovo. The handset features a 3,900 mAh battery, which the company said should allow it to survive two days between charges. And earlier this month Huawei announced the P8 Max with a 4,360mAh battery - although the size of the device's 6.8in (17.3cm) display means that many people would consider it more a call-enabled tablet than a phone. Some lesser-known handset-makers have opted to fit even bigger, bulkier parts. Philips's Android-powered Xenium W6610, released last year, has a 5,300mAh cell, allowing it to endure up to three days of heavy use. And the recently-released Elephone P5000 currently claims the lead with a 5350mAh battery, which the Chinese company says is large enough to let it stretch to four days of \"continuous use\". At a time when it has become the norm for manufacturers to build smartphones with non-removable batteries, it might be expected that those with bigger capacities would enjoy stronger sales. But one analyst said that despite what shoppers tell surveys, when it comes to buying a personal handset they tend to prioritise other issues such as photo quality, brand or cost. \"If a handset fails to last a minimum of a day then it won't sell, but once you get past that it doesn't really drive demand,\" said Tim Coulling from the market research firm Canalys. \"Most people have at least one opportunity to charge their phone within that time period and there is also a market in battery packs for power-users. \"The other thing is that the more battery life you have the more you end up using your phone anyway.

The grant was pledged in 2009 by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. The funds have so far been used to develop a research programme on North Africa, focused on politics, economics and society. The student demonstrators called on the LSE management to \"repay\" the \u00a3300,000 already spent by creating a scholarship fund for underprivileged Libyan students. The students also urged the university to revoke the LSE alumni status of Libyan leader Col Gaddafi's second son Saif al-Islam, who studied at the university from 2003 to 2008, gaining both a Master of Science degree and a doctorate. They called for a public commitment that no grants from officials \"of such oppressive regimes\" would be accepted in the future, as well as a public statement denouncing the recent \"gross violations of human rights\" by the Gaddafi regime. One of the protesters, Ashok Kumar, who is also education officer for the LSE students' union, said: \"I think it's reprehensible that the university continues to benefit from money that was stolen from the Libyan people and it's only right to return it to the people who are now being murdered in the streets fighting for their freedom.\" The money should be returned either as scholarships to underprivileged students, or \"to the families of those who have been murdered and who continue to be murdered\", he said. In a statement, the university said the LSE Director \"noted the message\" from the students. \"He shares the students' revulsion at the recent violence and gross violations of human rights in Libya, and much regrets the association of the School's name with Saif Gaddafi and the actions of the Libyan regime. \"The School's statement of 21 February made clear that School engagement with the present Libyan authorities, covering a number of programmes, has already finished or has been stopped following the events of the weekend of 19-20 February.\" The university said no more of the \u00a31.5m donation from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation would be accepted. It said about half of the \u00a3300,000 already accepted had been spent and its council would now consider what to do with the remaining funds, taking into account the views of LSE students.

The Comres poll of 1,005 adults across the 14 seats suggested a 13-point swing from the Lib Dems to the Conservatives, with Labour, UKIP and the Greens also making gains at the expense of Mr Clegg's party. But the Lib Dem leader told LBC radio the poll had questioned the equivalent of 72 people per seat \"without even mentioning the candidates' names\". \"Polls like that are just absolute baloney,\" he said. \"The bogus science from some of this stuff is just extraordinary.\" He added: \"We will win so many more seats than this endless cottage industry of pessimistic punditry allows for.\" His party says there are 20 marginal seats where a Conservative win, at the expense of the Liberal Democrats, would result in a minority Conservative government reliant on UKIP and DUP votes to stay in power \"an alliance that will drag Britain further and further to the right\". The Lib Dems have dubbed the alliance \"Blukip\". The seats are; St Ives, St Austell and Newquay, North Cornwall, North Devon, Torbay, Cheadle, Hazel Grove, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Solihull, Brecon and Radnorshire, Bath, Montgomeryshire, Maidstone, Chippenham, Berwickshire, Watford, Mid Dorset and North Poole, Taunton, Somerton and Frome and Oxford West and Abingdon. At a news conference in Cheadle, Mr Clegg said that would mean an alliance involving people who did not believe in climate change, wanted to bring back the death penalty and who were against gay rights: \"There's a real prospect that David Cameron may have to rely on those people to stay in Number 10.\" Mr Clegg said he wanted to \"lift the lid\" on a \"genuine threat to our country\" - because he said moderate Conservative voters in marginal seats were being told if they did not vote Conservative, they would end up with a Labour administration propped up by the SNP. He said \"moderate, centre-ground\" voters did not want David Cameron being \"held hostage\" by the \"swivel-eyed brigade\" on the Conservative backbenches who had been \"waiting for its moment to reclaim the Conservative Party for years\".", "summary": "Nick Clegg has dismissed opinion polls suggesting his party could be wiped out in south-west England as \"absolute baloney\".", "human_descriptions": ["First name of the person in summary is not supported by the source text."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 1701}

The firm reported 173 million daily users, up 4% on the prior quarter. But the company is struggling with fierce competition from Facebook, which offers similar features. Snap's stock, which was priced at $17 for its public offering in March, is now trading at less than $14. On Thursday, chief executive Evan Spiegel pledged that he and fellow co-founder Robert Murphy would not sell any of their own shares this year, as a sign of confidence in the firm's prospects. The shares were worth billions at the time of the IPO. \"We believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap,\" he told analysts on a call after the results were released. Snap made its name as a messaging app, with texts that would disappear. It now offers video stories, maps and other features. The firm said it is working to woo advertisers with low prices and evidence that its ads are working - features it hopes will set it apart from rivals. Revenue over the three months to the end of June was $181.7m, more than double the same period in 2016. But expenses grew even faster, reaching more than $630.6m for the quarter, including expenses related to stock-based compensation. Snap's user base increased by more than 20% year-on-year. But the firm added just seven million new users in the quarter, compared to eight million in the first three months of the year. Shares in the firm fell more than 14% in after-hours trade. Mr Spiegel said the company was making \"a lot of progress\". He estimated that a quarter of people with smart phones in the US, UK and France use Snapchat every day, with users typically spending more than 30 minutes daily on the site. Snap is not the only young company that has stumbled after going public while facing off with one of the tech giants. The prepared meal company Blue Apron, which started trading in June, has also lost much of its value. Analysts say Amazon's plan to acquire Whole Foods, combining its delivery strength with a well-known grocer, has dimmed its prospects. On Thursday, in its first earnings report since its stock market debut, Blue Apron reported more than $238m in revenue for the three months to the end of June and losses of $31.6m.

A decision whether to turn off his life support machines is being considered by the High Court. Connie Yates and Chris Gard want to take their son who has progressive muscle weakness to the US. A crowdfunding campaign for the trip is now less than \u00a360,000 short of its \u00a31.3m target. The judge is analysing medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division before deciding what option is in Charlie's best interests. The neurologist who would oversee the treatment told the court that while Charlie was in the \"terminal stage\" of his illness, treating him would be compassionate. He said the therapy, which would be tried for six months, would provide a \"small chance\" of a meaningful improvement in Charlie's brain function. \"[Charlie] may be able to interact. To smile. To look at objects,\" he said. Sophia Roper, representing Charlie's parents, also told the court there was \"no evidence that he is on a regular basis in pain\". Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital said the baby receives 24-hour care and should be allowed to die with dignity. But the couple, who live in London, believe seven-month-old Charlie may have a chance of surviving if he receives treatment abroad. \"We just want to have our chance. It would never be a cure but it could help him live. If it saves him, amazing,\" Miss Yates said. \"I want to save others. Even if Charlie doesn't make it through this, I don't ever want another mum and their child to go through this.\" Though born healthy in August, Charlie began to lose weight and strength by the time he was eight weeks old. He was admitted to Great Ormond Street in October after developing aspiration pneumonia and was diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Last month, his parents told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme they would continue to fight for their child's survival. They said: \"He can move his mouth, he can move his hands. He can't open them fully, but he can still open his eyes and see us, in response to us.\" An online campaign raised an initial \u00a31.2m, but an extra \u00a3100,000 is now needed to help pay fees on the GoFundMe website and extend Charlie's stay in America. While it is free to host a campaign on GoFundMe.com, fees are deducted from each donation. In the UK 5% of each donation goes towards supporting GoFundMe, while 2.68% is charged for processing fees plus VAT. Those paying towards UK-based campaigns from outside the European Economic Area can expect up to 9.48% of their donation to go towards these fees, the website says. Charlie is thought to be just one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said it had \"exhausted\" all proven treatment options. \"We cannot imagine how hugely distressing this is for his family,\" they added. \"We continue to support them in every way we can, while advocating, what we believe, is best for Charlie.\"", "summary": "A terminally ill baby at the centre of a legal battle to take him to the US for treatment may be able to smile, a court has heard.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 1459}

A funeral mass and burial took place at St Patrick's Church in Clonoe, near Coalisland. She was one of 57 Irish migrants hired to build a stretch of railway in Pennsylvania known as Duffy's Cut. Within six weeks of arriving in Philadelphia, all 57 workers - who hailed from counties Donegal, Tyrone and Londonderry - were dead. It is thought some died from cholera, while others were murdered by local people who believed the immigrants were spreading the disease. Most were buried anonymously in a mass grave near the shanty town where they lived and worked, but Catherine was among several workers buried separately. Officials with the Philadelphia and Columbia railroad never notified the immigrants' families of their deaths. Parish priest Father Benny Fee told the funeral: \"Catherine is one of our own, she's no stranger, she has Tyrone blood in her veins, but we know so little about her. \"What we do know is that she knew suffering. She was married and already widowed at the tender age of 29 - before she was 30 she had loved and lost. We also know she knew poverty, she knew what it was to have nothing in her purse. \"She took the boat to the USA for no other reason than she had no choice - she could stay at home and starve, or she could gamble on taking a boat across the Atlantic and with a bit of luck catch the tail of the American dream. \"But as Christy Moore's song Duffy's Cut says so well, she was sailing into Hell and less than two months into her arrival in the new world, she and her 56 Irish companions in Duffy's Cut were dead and buried in unmarked graves.\" This is the second repatriation of remains found at Duffy's Cut, now a wooded area behind suburban homes in the borough of Malvern, about 20 miles west of Philadelphia.

An investigation into what happened to the 57 Irish workers began in 2002, when Malvern's Immaculata University professor Bill Watson, his twin brother Frank, a Lutheran minister, and fellow Immaculata professor Earl Schandelmeier, began the Duffy's Cut archival and research project. The trio accompanied Catherine on her journey home to County Tyrone and attended the wake and the funeral in Clonoe.

{"text": "The hosts went ahead after 14 seconds when a poor Hugo Lloris clearance led to Jesus Navas brilliantly chipping in. Alvaro Negredo's shot went in off Sandro and Sergio Aguero turned in a cross to put City 3-0 up at half-time. Media playback is not supported on this device . Aguero again slotted in before Negredo's 18-yard strike and a side-footed Navas shot completed the rout. City have struggled on their travels this season but at home they have been an irresistible force and they were once again in sublime form at Etihad Stadium, where they have a 100% record in the present campaign with six wins from as many games. The movement and ruthlessness of Aguero, the invention of Samir Nasri, the midfield power of Yaya Toure and pace of Navas was too much for a shell-shocked Spurs as they suffered their biggest league defeat since losing 7-1 to Newcastle in December 1996. The defeat left Tottenham with just one point from their last three top-flight outings and the drop in form has put them ninth in the Premier League. Spurs had only conceded one league goal on the road this season - and six in total - but any hope they may have had before the game evaporated after just 14 seconds. \"Tottenham have taken a hammering from a Manchester City side who have achieved an emphatic win with an exhilarating performance. City have won six out of six in the Premier League this season and scored 26 goals in the process. They were brilliant from the start.\" Lloris sent a clearance straight to Aguero and, even though the Tottenham keeper parried the Argentine's resulting 22-yard shot, he was beaten when Navas got to the loose ball ahead of Younes Kaboul and brilliantly scored with a first-time chip. The visitors tried to respond and City centre-back Martin Demichelis cleared an Erik Lamela shot off his goal-line after keeper Costel Pantilimon had missed a low Kyle Walker cross. However, that was as good as it got for Tottenham as City stunned their rivals. Aguero latched on to a Nasri cross and, despite Lloris getting a hand to the striker's chipped shot, the ball fell to Negredo, whose shot rebounded off Kaboul and Sandro on the way into the net. City right-back Pablo Zabaleta then released Navas on the right flank and the Spaniard's inviting low cross was expertly turned in from Aguero as the hosts all-but wrapped up the game before half-time. Media playback is not supported on this device . Pellegrini's side continued to dominate after the break and Toure played a one-two with Negredo before surging into the Tottenham box and squaring for Aguero to slot in his 14th goal in 11 games for the club this season. A Nasri effort came back off the crossbar before the quality of Negredo's finish for City's fifth then epitomised the home side's confidence. The Spain forward produced a drag back from Fernandinho's through ball to leave defender Michael Dawson trailing before rifling a shot past Lloris from the edge of the box. Pantilimon had to save an angled shot from recalled Spurs striker Emmanuel Adebayor but it was a rare chance for the visitors, whose misery was compounded when Navas raced clear and slotted in a sixth for City.

Speaking to Sunday Politics Wales, Ms Bayoumi said: \"Just to put it in to some context, there was obviously existing UK legislation going back to the 70s that protected, for example, employee rights in respect of discrimination, so it's important to remember that. \"But yes absolutely, I do think that there will be a slow erosion of the existing rights and protections, that really is in line with the debate that we've heard.\" The UK government has proposed replacing the Human Rights Act 1998, which could curtail the role of the European Court of Human Rights.

The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the street, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries. The prosecution has alleged that Mr Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk. In March the actor told the court he was not drunk and was not driving the car.

{"text": "The so-called Valley fire is thought to be one of the worst in the state's history, and is still only 30% contained, spanning three counties. One disabled woman has died and four firefighters have been injured, while 23,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Two dozen fires are raging in Oregon, California and Washington state. But the most destruction is in California, where mandatory evacuation orders have been lifted in some areas so residents can return to survey the devastation. Firefighters are scrambling to protect not only homes but the state's famed giant Sequoia trees, as the largest of a dozen fires edges ever closer to one of the national parks in which they grow. While the Valley fire has been the most destructive, covering an area twice the size of San Francisco, a second known as the Butte fire, outside Sacramento, has claimed 166 homes. Firefighters say it is covering 71,780 acres (29,048 hectares) and is now 40% contained. Officials say fire teams have been helped by cooler weather and higher humidity, although the forecast is for higher temperatures to return at the weekend . In California, the sound of summer is the crackle of flames. No one here in Lake County can remember anything like the Valley Fire. Firefighters say it has already consumed an area twice the size of San Francisco. And still it burns, leaving behind a landscape drained of colour, silent and lifeless. Ranches which stood here for more than a century were wiped out in seconds. And in the little communities of Cobb, Middletown and Hidden Valley, entire streets have been destroyed. For mile after mile the ashes are still smouldering. Most people have not yet been allowed to return to inspect the damage but when they do many will find that there is nothing to salvage. Cooler weather with some moisture in the air is helping but it will take more than that to stop the blaze. The fires burns and burns and California is counting the cost. In northern California, people who have been evacuated from their homes or lost their homes completely are gathered at emergency centres and high schools. Andy Elliott, a British firefighter working to battle the Valley fire, said it is one of the most extreme in California for a long time. Firefighters are calling it a \"career fire\", such is its speed and force, he said. \"The fire behaviour is unprecedented.\" Mr Elliot said he knew the four injured firefighters and had breakfast with them just before they were hurt. \"It's a very extreme incident... very sad.\" California is used to battling raging wildfires. But after a four-year drought, the state is suffering more than usual - 5,255 fires have scorched 217,827 acres of land so far this year, compared with 3,638 fires burning 90,894 acres during the same period last year. Northern California is currently bearing the brunt of the blazes, with 13,000 firefighters working 24-hour shifts to try to contain more than a dozen fires sweeping across parched hillsides in Butte, Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties. But Calfire's Lynnette Round says more wildfires could start anywhere in the state at any given moment. \"The terrain is so dried up that even if it rains a little, trees and brush are so dry, they could ignite at any time,\" she says. Southern California typically experiences its worst wildfires in October and November, when ferocious Santa Ana winds - which blow from the desert to the coast - can reach up to 80mph and whip blazes across swathes of arid land. The state's largest wildfire in recent years was in San Diego county in 2003. That burned 273,246 acres, 2,820 buildings and led to 15 deaths. California's deadliest wildfire on record was also in southern California, according to Calfire. Twenty-nine people died in Los Angeles county in 1933.

A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS \"caliphate\", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. \"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.

It will now be up to an examining judge to decide whether or not to order a trial. But if it goes ahead it would be the first trial in France for bullying (moral harassment) of such a large company. As well as the former CEO, other figures could also face trial including his right-hand man Louis-Pierre Wenes, human resources head Olivier Barberot and four other directors. In 2006, Mr Lombard announced plans to cut 22,000 jobs and move another 14,000 workers, as France Telecom pushed for greater efficiency in the wake of privatisation two years earlier. According to an internal document cited by French media, he told a high-level meeting that he would \"do it one way or another, through the window or through the door\". In submissions made late last month, the Paris prosecutor accuses France Telecom of enacting a policy in 2007 that resulted in unsettling workers and creating a \"professional climate that provoked anxiety\" at the time of a \"delicate restructuring\" of the company, a judicial source told AFP news agency. The true number of suicides involving staff is unclear, but 60 people are thought to have taken their lives over a three-year period, and unions say as many as 35 died in 2008 and 2009. Officials speak of 19 deaths during the two years, 12 attempted suicides and eight other cases involving depression or related illnesses.

Alongside this, like its \"big four\" peers - Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - Tesco has been hit by competition from discount rivals Lidl and Aldi. The UK has also seen a broad change in shopping habits, with many customers preferring to shop little and often at small convenience stores, instead of doing a once-a-week \"big shop\". In April last year, the company reported a record pre-tax loss of \u00a36.4bn for the year to February, marking the biggest loss reported to date by a British retailer. Mr Lewis has focused on price cuts and putting more staff in stores in an attempt to revive sales.

Carvings and sculptures of unicorns can be found on historic buildings, such as the National War Museum at Edinburgh Castle. A tapestry called, Mystic Hunt of the Unicorn, hangs in Stirling Castle and a unicorn is a feature of a fountain in the courtyard at Linlithgow Palace. On the Black Isle in the Highlands, The Stables in Cromarty has a large unicorn sculpture. The unicorn has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th Century when it was used on an early form of the Scottish coat of arms by William I. Reasons for the appearance of a unicorn include a theory that narwhal, a whale with long tusks protruding from their heads, were seen in Scottish waters after straying from their usual range in the Arctic. Unicorns were also written about by the ancient Celts, Persians, Romans and Greeks, and were often described as an elegant white horse-like creature with a single horn capable of magical properties. Wales and England are among other nations that also celebrate fabled beasts. The Welsh flag features a red dragon connected to one of the country's legends, while England's patron saint St George is said to have killed a dragon. Artist Fox's other artwork has also involved animals, but of varieties that can be found running around the Scottish countryside. He said: \"I was thrilled to be asked to create this unique sculpture of a unicorn to mark National Unicorn Day. \"My previous work includes deer, badgers, foxes and rabbits which bring homes, gardens, parks and public spaces to life. \"It has been very inspiring for me to work on this noble and spiritual animal for the first time and to help promote Scotland at the same time.\"", "summary": "A sculpture of a unicorn has been unveiled to mark National Unicorn Day.", "human_descriptions": ["The source text doesn't say the sculpture is being unveiled, only that it was created."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 1739}

That put Ahly level on points with Zanaco, and with identical head-to-heads, Ahly went through, above the Zambians, on goal difference. Zanaco knew a point in Casablanca would have been enough to put them into the last eight, but they were thwarted by a 68th-minute goal from Wydad's Achraf Bencharki in front of the 80,000-capacity stadium. Bencharki's goal came nine minutes after Zanaco defender Taonga Bwenbya was sent off having been yellow-carded a second time. It was the first Champions League loss suffered by Zanaco this season and only the third goal they had conceded after four wins and five draws in qualifying and group matches. Al Ahly, who began their match against Coton Sport knowing only a win would take them through to the knockout stage for the first time since 2013, suffered an early setback. They fell behind at the Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria after 12 minutes when veteran defender Ahmed Fathy conceded an own-goal. Amr Gamal came to Ahly's rescue with an equaliser and he also scored the third Ahly goal after Abdallah El Said had given the Cairo club a 2-1 half-time lead.

{"text": "David Greenwood said fewer than 100 of the estimated 1,400 victims identified in the Jay Report have taken part in a raft of new enquiries. He believes \"radical change\" is needed for more victims to come forward. It is nearly a year since the report into the shocking scale of abuse in the South Yorkshire town was published. Mr Greenwood, who works for 58 of the girls subjected to sexual abuse by gangs of men in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, concedes that improvements have been made locally in the past 12 months. Two of the agencies that bore the brunt of criticism in the aftermath of the publication, South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham Council, have made progress but a truly independent organisation is needed to gain the trust of some survivors, he said. \"Both agencies have improved in Rotherham in the last 12 months but survivors of exploitation will be unwilling to come forward to them unless radical changes are made. \"An agency independent from South Yorkshire Police and RMBC [Rotherham Council] is essential for the 1,400 young women who need help. \"I am aware of only around 50 to 60 girls having come forward. This means there are around 1,350 whose lives could be improved with specialist help,\" he added. The report by Prof Alexis Jay, published on 26 August 2014, detailed how children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated. It revealed \"blatant\" collective failures by the council's leadership, senior managers had \"underplayed\" the scale of the problem and South Yorkshire Police had failed to prioritise the issue. Its findings provoked outrage and a wave of resignations followed in its wake, the most high profile of which was South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner, Shaun Wright, who had been in charge of children's services in the town during the period some of the abuse happened. The council was later deemed \"not fit for purpose\" by government inspectors and its powers were handed over to government-appointed commissioners. The police now have a dedicated team of more than 60 working on child sexual exploitation (CSE) and its joint operation with the council and the Crown Prosecution Service, Operation Clover, has brought some suspected perpetrators before the courts. The police insist they are working hard to restore trust with those affected by CSE. Rotherham's police commander, Ch Supt Jason Harwin, said: \"Over the last 12 months, if nothing else, restoring confidence has been really, really important and we've still got a journey to go on. \"The key focus has been around the victims and survivors. We need to understand better what the issues are for them and we could have done better and what we need to do for the future.\" Mr Harwin said he understands the public want to see perpetrators jailed and that his force has arrested 460 people for child abuse offences in the last 12 months - with 76 of these suspected of involvement in \"grooming and facilitation\". And he said 22 people have been charged with CSE-related offences in Rotherham, and there are currently 46 live CSE investigations in the town. But Mr Greenwood believes despite South Yorkshire Police's best efforts a new approach is needed to convince more victims to speak up. \"Only when large numbers of girls affected feel able to speak to the police and with confidence that they will be believed, protected and supported will we know more,\" he said. \"I have spoken with many girls who simply want nothing to do with the police at present and until the police put in place really good tailor-made support from specialist and dedicated officers they will not engage.\" \"I would like to see a truly independent agency offering survivors good quality support, protection, talking therapies, help with housing, childcare and education. \"We still have a long way to go.\"", "summary": "Fewer than 60 of the girls identified in the Rotherham abuse report have come forward a year on, according to the man who led the inquiry.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states that the man who led the inquiry said fewer than 60 girls have come forward, but the text does not state that David Greenwood led the inquiry.

{"text": "The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. \"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. \"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. \"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. \"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"", "summary": "Activity in the UK's manufacturing sector fell to a three-year low in April, according to a closely watched survey.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 103}
{"text": "Concerned that their messages may be intercepted, the leadership has also banned members from using smart phones. The group has long run what is regarded as a slick media machine. Even without smart phones, it has been known for its sophisticated handling of social media, a reputation at odds with its regular bans on communication technology for Somali citizens. In particular, it has made extensive use of Twitter in order to get its message across. It has also devoted considerable resources to producing a series of promotional videos. Al-Shabab's material aims to spread the group's ideology of establishing an Islamic state in Somalia, in line with al-Qaeda's stated ambition of setting up a global Islamic caliphate. It wants to achieve this both by military conquest and also the conversion of souls - for which communication technology is a key tool. Al-Shabab's well-produced video documentaries deliver the jihadi narrative in an appealing form to Somali audiences in the diaspora. They are aimed at young people of Somali origin such as Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a suspect in last year's Westgate mall attack in Kenya. His family is said to have moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. The group's documentaries are produced by its media arm, the al-Kataib foundation. Many of them show al-Shabab engaging in charity work and other activities that depict the group as a legitimate authority. However, they can also be quite gruesome - showing the corpses of those they have killed, including alleged spies who are often beheaded. And they contain threats to their perceived enemies - in Somalia, neighbouring countries such as Kenya which are helping Somalia's government and the West. The videos portray al-Shabab's fight as part of a wider global conflict in which Islam is under threat. Al-Shabab also has its own radio station, Radio Andalus. The group has acquired half a dozen relay stations, mainly by seizing private radio stations such as HornAfrik, Holy Koran Radio and the Global Broadcasting Corporation radio and their equipment - including some from the BBC. The website Kismaayo News reported that by 2013, the group had 50 journalists working for Andalus radio. When it comes to recruiting presenters, al-Shabab is known for its attention to detail. It generally takes care to use presenters with British or American accents to deliver its English language audio statements. With statements in Arabic, standard Arabic is used, and the presenters clearly have a high level of education in the language and in Islamic texts. Swahili-language presenters use classical Kiswahili as spoken in Tanzania and coastal Kenya. The majority of al-Shabab's audio output, though, is in Somali and is presented articulately and fluently. A number of pro-al-Shabab websites have emerged, which host material produced by the group and act as vehicles for furthering its military aims. The content is intended to frustrate efforts by the Somali government and its allies - mainly the African Union forces fighting in Somalia - to eliminate the group. Al-Shabab has often used Twitter to challenge the veracity of claims made by the African Union forces. Its Twitter accounts are now closed, but Kenya's military spokesman Maj-Gen Chirchir has continued to attack the group's media policy. On 20 May he tweeted: \"Al Shabaab Courtesy calls! The more videos you release to scare Kenyans the more WE make visitations. Consider peace, the better option.\" When the group's official spokesman, Sheikh Ali Dheere, appears on video, he is surrounded by fighters. He reportedly answers to the group's overall leader and oversees a bevy of apparently enthusiastic journalists. Al-Shabab has honed its media strategy as aggressively as it has enforced its bans on the Somali population. As the group loses control of parts of the country, it has issued a series of bans on technology: . BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

It is the first time loyalist killings have been investigated as a result of details in the Boston tapes. Police say the two men were killed simply because of their religion. Mr Devine, a 37-year-old father-of-three, was shot in front of his 13-year-old son at his home in Fallswater Street in west Belfast. Mr O'Hara, a father-of-five, was working as a taxi driver when he was shot in Dunluce Avenue in south Belfast in April 1991. Police have said they have new information that could help them to catch the killers. \"As a result of information we have recently received, we believe we are now in a position to progress both of these investigations. \"However, we need the help of the public,\" said Det Insp Neil McGuinness. The Police Service of Northern Ireland will not comment on the nature of the new information. But the BBC believes the decision to re-open these cases was taken after detectives listened to tapes seized from Boston College in recent months. Dozens of former paramilitaries, most of them republican, gave interviews to university researchers compiling an oral history of the Troubles. They did so on the understanding that the tapes would not be made public until after their deaths. But police took legal action and were granted permission to access some of the recordings. It is understood police believe information contained on some of the seized tapes could help them identify those responsible for these two killings. Detectives are now trying to find other supporting evidence. They have appealed to anyone with information about the killings to come forward.", "summary": "Police are investigating two loyalist murders after listening to interviews with former paramilitaries at Boston College.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 3220}
{"text": "The victim who cannot be named to protect her safety, was abused for more than 10 years, bearing two children. Violence against women is endemic in Afghanistan and victims of sexual abuse are often themselves jailed for \"moral crimes\". I met the victim, who is in her early twenties, for the first time last year after the trial against her father was suspended with the judge asking for DNA evidence. She was pregnant as a result of the abuse and held her four-year-old on her lap. \"This is my daughter and my father's daughter,\" she said. \"She is the result of my father raping me. We are both mother and daughter and sisters at the same time.\" As sunlight streamed through the drawn curtains of the impoverished home she shares with her mother, she told me the story she had presented in court for the first time last summer. According to the victim, the abuse began when her father returned from Iran after eight years abroad. She was 12 years old. \"I was expecting that my father will love me the way my uncles love their children because I was thirsty for a dad's love during all the years I was deprived of him,\" she says. \"But when I found myself in my father's arms it was too much.\" She recalls how he touched her intimately, making her feel uncomfortable. \"I went to my grandmother and complained but she blamed me. I was told that every father caresses his children.\" Then one night her father raped her: \"I was scared badly, I was shocked and lay in the corner of the room and didn't know what to do.\" When she became pregnant, the father moved the family to another province. The baby was born but he took it away - she never saw it again. The abuse lasted more than 10 years, during which the daughter went through multiple pregnancies and abortions. She says that her father used a variety of drugs which she later learned were attempts at contraception. Eventually another child was born. \"When I became pregnant again, I kept the baby and didn't abort my child,\" she says: \"I kept it to have proof for my claims against my father - my child was my only evidence.\" With the support of her mother, she finally managed to end the abuse. The final attack, she told me, happened in July last year, one day before Eid. \"Me and my mother had told the whole story to the mullah, neighbourhood elders and the district police and they told us to inform them if I was attacked again.\" That night the father sent his wife out of the home before assaulting his daughter again. He was arrested as the mother returned with police and elders as witnesses. Even though he was put on trial, the daughter's ordeal was far from over. As the father denied all charges, claiming his daughter had extramarital relationships with other men, the victim herself was challenged in court. \"The judge questioned me, asking why I didn't kill the baby that was in my belly?\" she told me. \"I answered that if I killed the child I could be accused of aborting it because the father was another person. I kept my child to prove I have a case against my father.\" The court then suspended the trial, asking for DNA samples of the accused, the victim and her daughter. What followed was a campaign to seek justice. The victim had taken the unusual step of appearing on Afghan television to tell her story. Women's rights activists began organising support. There are virtually no facilities for genetic forensic testing in Afghanistan, making foreign assistance imperative. The woman's supporters lobbied embassies and non-governmental organisations for help, But it still took almost a year before a DNA test could be arranged, by which time the victim had given birth to another child. Finally a committee of officials from the attorney general's office and the interior ministry took on the task. \"They took blood and saliva samples from the father, the woman and her children and transferred them to the US via Bagram airbase,\" says Ruhulla, the victim's lawyer. \"If we didn't have this test result, my client would have been punished based on the codes and laws of this country,\" she says. The samples were processed by the US firm \"Ideal Innovations\", specialists in forensic testing who are also active in Afghanistan, providing fingerprint and biometric identification technology. They did the test for free. When the results were finally returned they showed that the accused had indeed fathered his daughter's children. The judge sentenced him to death. The case is not yet closed, though. The father is appealing against the sentence, protesting his innocence. DNA evidence is very rare in Afghan court cases, making this trial highly unusual. The victim, meanwhile, told me that even if her abuser is executed, she remains fearful. \"I'm so worried about the future of my children,\" she says \"What will I tell them when they are older and ask me about their father?\"", "summary": "A court in Afghanistan has sentenced a man to death for repeatedly raping his daughter.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 247}

{"text": "Fairer outcomes remained an \"entrenched\" problem, she said, at an event promoting social mobility. Too many pupils fail to reach their potential, said Ms Greening. Making the most of all young people's talent was a \"hard, cold, economic imperative,\" she said. \"Children from high-income backgrounds who show signs of low academic ability at age five, are 35% more likely to become high earners than their poorer peers who show early signs of high ability,\" Ms Greening told a Social Mobility Commission event. Ms Greening said giving a fairer opportunity to all pupils remained a \"really hard long slog\". In her own family, she said she was the first to go to university. And the education secretary said that she had never planned to be a politician - and could remember her father shouting at out-of-touch politicians on the television. He was \"frustrated that he felt they didn't really talk about his life,\" she said. Ms Greening said that poorer pupils, despite any early signs of talent, were more likely to leave school without A-levels and miss out on the chance to go to university. Even among those who went to university, there were still inequalities. \"Graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who do make it to the top jobs still earn, on average, over \u00c2\u00a32,200 a year less than their colleagues who happen to have been born to professional or managerial parents,\" she said. This was not just economic disadvantage, but also geographic, with some parts of England having much lower attainment, she said. A child living in one of the country's most disadvantaged areas was 27 times more likely to go to an inadequate school than a child in the most advantaged area, said Ms Greening. She said the government's \"opportunity areas\" would help to focus support in such deprived areas. And ensuring a supply of quality teachers could make a big difference to accelerating attainment. With the end of European Union membership, she said, it would become an economic necessity to make better use of all young people's abilities. Rather than employers \"scouring the world\" to find staff, she said, employers would need to focus more on making better use of home-grown talent. The UK had lower levels of productivity than many competitors, much of which was down to low levels of education, and that showed the importance of investing in education and training. But this week the education secretary faced strong criticism from the Public Accounts Committee, who warned the Department for Education had failed to engage with the seriousness of funding problems facing schools. MPs said ministers were failing to recognise the \"real-world consequences\" of their funding plans. The government has said that creating new grammar schools will promote social mobility. But Ms Greening said that any new grammars would also be accompanied by a \"new model\" for selection. \"We're talking about a new model of grammar schools and how selection can work,\" she said. \"It means an education system which caters for the very different talents and potential of different children - whether it's technical education, maths schools or whether it's giving local communities a choice over how selection works at local level. \"If we're really going to have things different - we have to be prepared to look at what that will take. \"Do we want to make sure though that new grammars will work effectively, collaboratively to lift attainment overall? Absolutely - that's precisely why there's so much work going on right now to make sure what we bring forward will be a new model of selection that works constructively to raise attainment.\"", "summary": "Education Secretary Justine Greening has called for a \"hard, cold, economic imperative\" to make better use of all young people's talents.", "human_descriptions": ["The name Justine is not supported by the source text", "The person was not calling for something but rather making a statement of fact."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3514}
{"text": "The High Administrative Court rejected an appeal by the government against a lower court's decision to stop it handing over Tiran and Sanafir. Cheers erupted as the judge delivered the verdict, saying the government had failed to provide evidence that the islands were originally Saudi. The transfer deal, signed last April, sparked rare protests in Egypt. Tiran and Sanafir are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. They are uninhabited apart from Egyptian troops and multi-national peacekeepers. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi said the islands had always belonged to Saudi Arabia and that Riyadh had asked Egypt to station troops there in 1950 to protect them. But Mr Sisi was accused of violating the constitution and \"selling\" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package announced during a visit to Cairo by King Salman. Saudi Arabia has backed Mr Sisi financially since he led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013. Uproar at the maritime border demarcation accord prompted protests across Egypt at which hundreds people were detained, according to human rights activists. A group of lawyers, including former presidential candidate Khaled Ali, also challenged the agreement at an administrative court. Mr Ali argued that a 1906 maritime treaty between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire stated that the islands were Egyptian. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia was not established until 1932. In June, the court nullified the border accord, ruling that Egyptian sovereignty over the islands held and could not be amended in favour of another state. The government subsequently lodged an appeal with the High Administrative Court. It is part of the State Council, a judicial body that gives legal advice to the government, drafts legislation, and exercises jurisdiction over administrative cases. On Monday, the High Administrative Court said it was the \"unanimous\" decision of its judges that Tiran and Sanafir were sovereign Egyptian territories.

Their extended tour is part of an effort to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the body. But scientists will gain further insights by comparing Scott Kelly with his Earthbound identical twin, Mark. A Soyuz capsule carrying Kelly, Kornienko and Russian crew member Sergey Volkov parachuted down on to a steppe in Kazakhstan at 10:26 local time (04:26 GMT). The mission is a record for the ISS and will give Cmdr Kelly a tally of 520 cumulative days in space, over four flights. In pictures: Scott Kelly's year in space . Tim Peake's space plant experiment . Cmdr Kelly has also returned rocket (salad) seeds that were taken up to the orbiting outpost by UK astronaut Tim Peake in December. They will be distributed to schools to allow pupils to compare their growth with rocket plants that have stayed on Earth. The idea behind the twin study is to help minimise extraneous factors as scientists research how genetically identical individuals respond to different conditions over a year. The harsh space environment takes its toll in the form of muscle atrophy, sleep problems, bone loss, vision impairment and radiation exposure. But some of the most pronounced effects are on the mind. Before landing, Cmdr Kelly told reporters during a live link-up: \"Physically I feel pretty good... but the hardest part is being isolated in the physical sense from people on the ground who are important to you. There's a loss of connection.\" From Kazakhstan, Cmdr Kelly will be flown to Houston in the US, where researchers at the US space agency (Nasa) will begin a series of scientific checks. Mark Kelly, who was an astronaut, now retired, has been undergoing tests of his own on Earth during his brother's sojourn on the ISS. Comparisons between the twins should allow scientists to deepen their understanding of the subtle physical and psychological shifts that occur during long stays on orbit. Nasa says the research should inform its stated aim of one day sending humans to Mars. After returning from an extended stay in the weightless environment of space, many astronauts have difficulty walking unaided. Shortly after landing, Kelly, Kornienko and Volkov will enter a medical tent to participate in a series of \"field tests\" that will assess their balance, co-ordination and ability to walk. Returning ISS crews have immediate access to medical assistance, but future crews to Mars will have little time to recover once they land on the Red Planet's surface. Scientists want to devise ways to prevent injury and improve their recovery time. \"We go through about an hour of field tests of various kinds - one is even like an obstacle course, where you run around, stand up from a sitting position and jump,\" Cmdr Kelly said. Despite the length of their flight, Kelly and Kornienko are still some way shy of the record for the longest single spaceflight, which is held by the Russian Valery Polyakov, who spent 437 consecutive days aboard the Mir space station in the mid-1990s. On Monday, Scott Kelly handed over command of the space station to his American colleague Timothy Kopra, who remains on the orbiting outpost with Tim Peake and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko.

Damilola, Our Loved Boy - about the murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor - receives three nominations, as do Fleabag and Happy Valley. See the full nominations list . The Crown is the main beneficiary of a rule change that means shows can be nominated in the main categories if they have mainly British talent, but haven't been made for a British broadcaster. That means the field is even more competitive than before, according to Bafta chair Jane Lush - which is one factor explaining why The Night Manager has missed out. \"There is so much investment in drama now that the competition is incredibly fierce,\" she said. Bafta juries have more big shows to consider when settling on the shortlists, she said. \"Whereas a few years ago people were choosing four [nominees] out of six contenders for drama series, they're now probably looking at 10 or even more. \"So it has just got increasingly competitive when the awards season comes around.\" Robbie Coltrane has been nominated for his fifth Bafta TV award for his role as a comedian accused of historic sex crimes in Channel 4's National Treasure. His competition includes Benedict Cumberbatch, up for his role as Richard III in The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses. Foy's fellow contenders in the leading actress category include Happy Valley's Sarah Lancashire and Nikki Amuka-Bird, recognised for her work in the BBC's adaptation of Zadie Smith's NW. Happy Valley is up for best drama series alongside The Crown, as are ITV's The Durrells and the BBC's War and Peace. But there is no room in that category for The Night Manager - despite it being shortlisted for six Bafta Craft Awards last month. Nor is there a space for Coronation Street in the soap and continuing drama category, where preference has been given to Casualty, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks.

{"text": "They were allegedly subject to sexual abuse and forced to beg on the streets. The owner, Rosa del Carmen Verduzco, and eight employees at the House of the Big Family have been arrested. Correspondents say it is one of Mexico's worst incidents of alleged child abuse at a children's institution in many years. The government said the building was home to 278 boys, 174 girls and six infants under the age of three. Also rescued were 138 adults aged up to 40, the government said. Reports say the residents were forced to live in terrible conditions. \"I'm in utter dismay because we weren't expecting the conditions we found at the group home,\" Michoacan Governor Salvador Jara said. The House of the Big Family has been operating for 40 years and was known locally as Mama Rosa's Home. The authorities began to investigate the home after parents complained that they were denied access to their children. One woman, who grew up at the home herself, gave birth to two children who were registered in the name of Ms Verduzco. When the mother left the home, aged 31, she was not allowed to take her children with her, investigators said. Mr Jara said the raid came after an official complaint was filed by the parents of five children who said they were being held at the home against their will. He said the complaint was filed more than a year ago, but did not specify why the authorities had not acted sooner. Local media had reported on allegations made against the home as far back as 2010. By Will Grant, BBC Mundo, Mexico City . Mexicans are waking up to the news with a sense of shock and disbelief - mainly at the sheer scale of the alleged abuse at Casa Mama Rosa. The list of accusations is long and serious: almost 500 children held against their will and sent into the streets to beg, their parents prevented fromt them, sexual and psychological abuse at what is a well-known and often praised children's home. As such, this certainly stands out from other stories of abuse in Mexican institutions and has sparked some uncomfortable questions. How long were the authorities aware of the accusations before they acted? Were corrupt officials involved in keeping those accusations silent? Meanwhile Rosa Verduzco herself is under arrest and facing a range of charges including sexual abuse and mistreatment of children. But over the 40 years she has been running the home, she has gained some influential and high-profile supporters, among them the renowned Mexican writer Enrique Krauze, who took to Twitter to defend her record. An article in newspaper El Universal said six families had alleged that Ms Verduzco refused to hand over their children to them. One mother told Universal reporters that she had taken her son to the home after a social worker had recommended it as a place for her child to get treatment for hyperactivity. The mother, Martha Ines Lopez Ramirez, said she was only allowed to see her son once every four months and only ever in the presence of a \"guard\". Ms Lopez said that her son seemed to have been drugged and showed signs of having been beaten. She told El Universal that all parents had been made to hand over custody of the children to Ms Verduzco, and sign a written agreement not to retrieve the children before they turned 18.

It follows a series of shop closures across the city centre in recent years, followed by the loss of a \u00c2\u00a31bn project to transform the shopping district, when developers plumped to invest in the out-of-town Parc Tawe instead. Robert Francis-Davies, Swansea council's cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, said they needed to examine what makes a winning city. \"Shopping is a major part of the city centre offer here, but a lot more needs to be available to generate the footfall our traders need,\" he said. \"The city centre has to become a place that people want to go - a destination that's both easy to get to and offers a range of events that will create a buzz and attract people.\" Initiatives have already begun to try and lure people back into town. This week retailers have been invited to take to the streets on temporary market stalls in order to drum up passing trade with a variety of themed events. Last weekend saw the re-launch of the Big Heart of Swansea loyalty card which offers discounts at participating stores within the city centre's Business Improvement District (BID). According to Russell Greenslade, chief executive of Swansea BID, around 500 shoppers snapped up the offer on its first day. \"The beauty of the loyalty card is that discounts can only be redeemed in-store,\" he said. \"This helps attract more visitors into the city centre and boosts our traders. It's one of many schemes on which we work closely with Swansea council to benefit our city centre businesses.\" But Julie Williamson, who chairs Swansea Bay's Federation of Small Businesses, said the success of the city lay with all businesses - not just the shops. \"Of course we need a healthy retail sector, but what keeps those shops going is the workers from other offices and businesses coming into town every day, and shopping in their lunch breaks and after work.

{"text": "To give some idea of the amount of the currency that represents - there were more than 90 billion banknotes in circulation in India last March. Most central banks destroy soiled and mutilated banknotes on a regular basis and replace them with new, crisp ones. The Reserve Bank of India, similarly, shreds such notes and makes briquettes of them. But they are not your usual briquettes. Briquettes - usually made of farm waste in India - are used for cooking, lighting and heating. They are cheaper than coal, have lower ash content, are less polluting, and easier to store and pack. They are mostly used as fuel in factory boilers. But briquettes made out of shredded cash are brittle and serve no such purpose, a senior central bank official told me. So the bank's 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across India will now snip the expired banknotes into the smallest of pieces and the resulting briquettes will be then dumped in India's vast landfills. Sometimes the shredded currency is also recycled to make files, calendars and paper weights and ballpoint pen shells, tea coasters, cups and small trays as souvenirs for guests. The practice is similar in the US: counterfeit banknotes are sent to the Secret Service, while unfit notes are shredded and sent to landfills or given away as souvenirs to the public touring the Federal Reserve Bank. Central bank officials believe shredding 20 billion banknotes will not be a huge challenge. In 2015-16 the Reserve Bank of India destroyed more than 16 billion soiled notes. More than 14 billion were removed in 2012-2013 after nearly 500,000 fake notes were found in the system. \"Destroying so much cash is not a challenge because we have enough shredding and briquetting machines with very high capacities.

{"text": "Set 238 to win, Pakistan reached their target with 23 balls to spare thanks to Sarfraz Ahmed's unbeaten 101 in Adelaide. Ireland captain William Porterfield earlier made 107, but his wicket triggered a slide to 237 all out. The Irish finish fifth in Pool B, behind West Indies on net run-rate, while Pakistan go on to meet Australia in Adelaide in the last eight on Friday. Before the tournament, Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom said it would be a \"failure\" if Porterfield's side did not reach the quarter-finals. But for the third World Cup in succession, the Irish have acquitted themselves well, winning three games and beating two Test-playing sides in West Indies and Zimbabwe. England won only two matches, neither against Test nations. Indeed, Ireland could have reasonably expected to go through with six points, only for their elimination to come as a result of several factors. Heavy losses to South Africa and India damaged their net run rate, West Indies earned three big wins to boost theirs, while Pakistan recovered from two opening defeats to claim four successive victories. This latest win continues the improvement of Misbah-ul-Haq's men, echoing the Pakistan side that began poorly when the tournament was last held in Australia and New Zealand in 1992, only to go and lift the trophy. For Ireland, their creditable showing will be used as evidence by those who say the next World Cup should not be cut from its current 14-team format to only 10 sides. The Irish still have the chance to qualify for that tournament as well as the opportunity to earn Test status through the 2017 Intercontinental Cup. Victory over Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval would have seen them progress past the first round of the World Cup for the second time, but they were unable to take enough runs from a disciplined attack, then lacked the penetration and accuracy to make the chase uncomfortable. Plenty of the Ireland top order got starts, but there was not enough support for Porterfield, who pulled, clipped and drove his way to the highest score made by an associate captain in a World Cup match. However, the collective accuracy of the Pakistan pace attack was impressive and, when left-hander Porterfield miscued Sohail Khan to mid-on, the lower order was exposed. Despite the sluggish nature of the wicket, the Irish regularly found trouble playing the short ball, with the last six wickets falling for 55 runs. Ireland's collection of medium-pacers and spinners may have been able to use the conditions to their advantage, but regular width aided the Pakistan cause. Sarfraz, dropped by wicketkeeper Gary Wilson standing up to Kevin O'Brien on 37, shared an opening stand of 120 with Ahmed Shahzad, whose cut shots benefitted from Irish inaccuracy. When he skied Stuart Thompson to mid-on and Haris Sohail was run-out in a mix-up with Sarfraz, Irish hopes were revived. But Misbah arrived to steady in a stand of 82, taking two sixes over the leg side before treading on his stumps off Alex Cusack with 30 still required. That left the patient Sarfraz to complete his maiden one-day international hundred, with Umar Akmal belting Paul Stirling down the ground to bring Ireland's spirited campaign to a close.

Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said. The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey. The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said. \"I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'\" said Mr Comey in a briefing. His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices. Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android. Mr Comey said he was \"very concerned\" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do. \"What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law,\" he said. \"I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law,\" he added.

The footballers' union says the strike will go on until the players received what they are owed. The strike involves players of more than 200 Argentine clubs. The two matches postponed were Rosario Central v Godoy Cruz, in the city of Rosario, and San Lorenzo v Belgrano, in Buenos Aires. The crisis began after senior officials at the Football Association (AFA) were implicated in a corruption scandal involving television broadcasting rights. The season should have resumed a month ago after the summer recess. But the crisis led the AFA to delay the start until this Friday. To try to avoid the strike, the government of Mauricio Macri made a $22m (\u00c2\u00a318m) payment on Thursday to the Argentine Football Association. The money was owed as compensation for the cancellation of a contract with the government, which held the broadcasting rights until this year. But the players' union says the money is not enough. They said most club presidents had spent and borrowed more money than they should have. The death in 2014 of Julio Grondona, who was president of the Argentine Football Association for 35 years, triggered the crisis.

{"text": "They have been removed to stop the spread of ash dieback, a fungal disease that can infect mature trees and saplings. Scientists have warned that if it is not contained it could change the landscape and affect our biodiversity. It has been found on around 100 sites in Northern Ireland. All those sites were planted with imported saplings, some of which had the infection. Infected ash trees were destroyed along with any others planted alongside. That led to the removal of 100,000 young trees. The disease is widespread in Europe where it is killing mature trees. In Northern Ireland, it is mostly in saplings planted within the past five years. It spreads on the wind by spores. Scientists at the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) in Belfast are trying to establish if that is happening in Northern Ireland yet. Prof Alistair McCracken, a plant pathologist with AFBI, said: \"This is a serious disease. In Denmark they say up to 90% of the ash trees have been infected. \"Now they haven't all died, but they have been affected and are looking quite sickly so potentially this could have a huge impact on the Northern Ireland environment.\" Infected ash trees will not recover, although mature trees can survive for a long time. The fungus appears between June and September on leaf litter. Each pinhead size fungus can produce large numbers of spores. When they land on a fresh ash leaf they germinate, penetrate the surface and grow into the stem. The first symptom is wilting leaves. As it gets worse the trees will develop a diamond-shaped dark-coloured lesion on the bark. In Denmark, Sweden and east European countries, where the disease has been present for 30 years, large numbers of trees have become infected. Scientists are worried about its impact in Northern Ireland, where ash is a common tree. They are carrying out a survey of more than 1,000 sites to identify any further problems. And they have asked for the public's help. The authorities have developed a smartphone app called Tree Check that the public can use to report potential problems, including a picture and a GPS position. They will then be assessed and, if necessary, the site visited by experts. Jim Crummie, plant health expert with the Forest Service urged the public to download the app and to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the authorities in the fight to combat the disease.

In Northern Ireland, astronomers say all five planets should come into view simultaneously by about 24 January. The Irish Astronomical Association said it will be a \"sight not to be missed\". However, successful planet spotting will depend on local weather conditions and the amount of cloud in the sky. Terry Moseley, a former president of the Irish Astronomical Association, said Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter are the only five planets that are ever visible from Earth with the naked eye, but it is rare to see all of them at once. He said that in the UK, the alignment would be visible in southern parts of England first and should come into view in Northern Ireland a few days later, as it lies further north. Mr Moseley added that four of the planets can be seen from Northern Ireland at the moment on clear nights, but added that \"elusive little Mercury\" is always the hardest to see because it is closest to the horizon. \"Mercury will be easiest to see from about 28 January to 2 February, but you should start looking from about 24 January in case the skies are cloudy later,\" Mr Moseley advised skywatchers. \"You should start looking from about 45 minutes before sunrise, and you'll need a good clear horizon to the south east,\" he added. \"Venus will be by far the brightest, a brilliant beacon above the south east horizon. Look about a hand-span to the left of Venus, and slightly below it, to try to spot Mercury, which will be much fainter, and not easy to find in the twilight glow.\" The director of Armagh Observatory, Mark Bailey, said the last time such a view was visible was January 2005. He will be talking to schoolchildren in Tandragee library, County Armagh, on Thursday, explaining what to look out for. Skywatchers will have to distinguish the row of planets from some very bright stars. Mr Bailey said that one of the brightest stars in the sky - Arcturus - will also form part of the alignment view, along with another star, Spica, more or less vertically below it. Observatory staff have produced images showing the alignment on the morning of Friday 22, January, shortly before Mercury is expected to come into view. Mr Moseley added: \"The group will be joined by the waning crescent moon from 1 February onwards, making an even more glorious sight.\" The pre-dawn sky show is best viewed from high ground, in places were there is little light pollution. \"You need a good, dark view towards the southern horizon,\" Mr Bailey said. He suggested locations such as Divis mountain in Belfast; the Sperrins in counties Londonderry and Tyrone and Slieve Beagh near the border with County Monaghan.

Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars. Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leading him to say that he needed \"leadership help\". Susan Fowler, who wrote the critical blog post about Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations. Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley . Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said. Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture. The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week. Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally. About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings. Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal. Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point. So as well as detailing what it has done to address those existing complaints, Uber will now have to be very clear about how it will handle such issues in future. Crucially, the lessons from this report should not be heeded by Uber alone. As many people have pointed out to me since we began reporting this story, this is a problem that affects the technology industry across the board.

{"text": "Mr Baran thought up the idea of making communication networks resilient to attack or traffic surges by splitting the data sent over them into chunks. His pioneering work was carried out in connection with Cold War military research. It would later form the basis of the academic network Arpanet which eventually led to the internet. Mr Baran first put forward the idea of slicing data into \"message blocks\" and using a distributed system of nodes to pass them on when working at the Rand Corporation in the mid-1960s. In his initial conception, Mr Baran said the system would operate by what he called \"hot-potato routing\". The work was done as part of a project to keep telecommunications networks operating even if a large part of them was knocked out by a first strike nuclear attack. The system would be better able to withstand an attack because it lacked a central hub through which all data or messages passed. This work found new relevance during the early days of the Arpanet, a network designed to aid US scientists communicate and which laid the foundations of the modern-day internet. Contributions from British scientist Donald Davies led to Mr Baran's ideas being adapted into a technology known as packet switching. This cuts data up into small chunks that are then despatched around the network. \"Paul wasn't afraid to go in directions counter to what everyone else thought was the right or only thing to do,\" Vinton Cerf, one of the fathers of the internet and a longtime friend of Baran, told the New York Times. Mr Baran died at home in Palo Alto, California from complications caused by lung cancer. \"He was a man of infinite patience,\" said his son David Baran. He added that his father had recently shown him a paper written in 1966 which speculated about what people would do with the telecommunication networks in the future. \"It spelled out this idea that by the year 2000 that people would be using online networks for shopping and news,\" he said. \"It was an absolute lunatic fringe idea.\"", "summary": "US scientist Paul Baran has died at the age of 74.", "human_descriptions": ["the summary states that Baran lived in california but not that he was a US scientist or even American.", "The summary did not state his age at time of death."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 2801}

Compared with those born a decade earlier, a larger percentage were now toddlers without signs of moderate or severe cognitive and motor delay. Changes to care are being credited with the improvement. About 30% of children included in the study who were born between the years 2000 and 2003 survived, but that rate increased to 36% for babies born in 2008 to 2011.

Prof Michael Cotten, one of the other lead researchers, said changes in the culture of neonatal intensive care units were behind the improvement. \"We've taken a big focus on preventing infections, and there's a lot more encouragement and support for the use of mothers' milk than there was 15 years ago, which has also been linked to better outcomes.\" There has also been a decrease in infection rates in neonatal intensive care units over the past two decades, which Prof Cotten said was important.

Ifab are keen to reach a decision in principle at Friday's gathering. \"The captain should be more than somebody who has a piece of material on their arm,\" Ifab technical director David Elleray told BBC Sport. \"Can we consult them more about how the game should be played? Should we encourage much better relationships between the captains and players? Should the captain also bear more responsibility?\" Former Premier League referee Elleray believes the measures may stop players crowding around referees, as only the captain would have the authority to talk to officials after what he describes as \"major incidents\". \"If that stops six players from each team going to talk the referee that will enhance respect and improve respect for the game,\" he said. \"When I was refereeing, sometimes you could say to a captain 'have a word with Freddy because he's getting quite close to a yellow card' and he could calm him down. \"You could explain decisions to a good captain and he could pass that on.\" Elleray confirmed that discussions have already taken place with an expert panel of players, coaches and referees and that there is widespread support for the plans. Other items on the agenda include a proposal to introduce sin-bins for yellow-card offences. The measure has been tested in Uefa development competitions and some amateur leagues in recent years. If approved, sin-bins will come in at youth and amateur levels and could be introduced to the professional game within two to three years.

The bombing was the latest in a series of attacks on the Farc by Colombian security forces. The two sides are holding peace talks but have not agreed a ceasefire. The Colombian air force said it bombed a rebel position near the town of Riosucio in north-western Choco province on Monday. Sources in the security forces later told local media that among those killed in the raid was Alfredo Alarcon Machado, better known by his alias, Roman Ruiz. However, Ruiz has been reported killed once before. Last year, sources in the security forces announced he had been killed, only for the head of the police to deny it later. Ruiz is believed to be the right-hand man of Pastor Alape, who is part of the Farc team negotiating with the Colombian government at peace talks in the Cuban capital, Havana. About 40 Farc rebels have been killed since the security forces resumed their bombing raids. President Juan Manuel Santos gave the order for the resumption after 11 soldiers were killed on 15 April in a Farc ambush in south-western Cauca province. The attack on the soldiers caused outrage in Colombia, with many questioning the rebels' commitment to the peace talks. The Farc had declared a unilateral ceasefire in December as a sign of its commitment to the talks. It argued the ambush in Cauca had been a \"defensive measure\" taken by its rebels as they came under pressure from the security forces. When the peace talks officially began in November 2012, President Juan Manuel Santos ruled out a ceasefire, arguing that the guerrilla had used them during previous negotiations to re-group and re-arm. In March of this year, he did however order the suspension of bombing raids. The peace talks have been going on for two and a half years during which the two sides have so far reached agreement on three topics on their five-point agenda. An estimated 220,000 people have died in a half century of armed conflict in Colombia.

Reform Scotland released written evidence it had sent to Transport Scotland's rail infrastructure strategy consultation. It has been submitted on its behalf by advisory board member Tom Harris, a former Labour transport minister in the UK government. He makes a range of suggestions including the need for \"bigger thinking\" in the long-term vision for Scotland's railways.

The law would allow women to terminate a pregnancy in any circumstances up to 12 weeks and in cases of incest, rape and foetal impairment up to 24 weeks. Abortion is currently illegal in Sierra Leone under any circumstances. Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and five Sierra Leonean organisations, wrote to President Koroma in February urging him to give the bill his assent. \"Unsafe abortions - often resulting from restrictive laws and poor access to sexual and reproductive health services, information, and education - is one of the main factors contributing to maternal deaths in Sierra Leone,\" their letter said. The World Health Organization estimates that Sierra Leone has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio at 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births last year. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Freetown, says the abortion issue has led to heated debates and protests on both sides. President Koroma has now referred the controversial legislation to the Constitutional Review Committee, which is currently reviewing the constitution. Our correspondent says it will decide whether to include the abortion law in its recommended changes to the constitution, which will be put to a referendum. When President Koroma sent the legislation back to parliament in January, he asked for it to be reviewed after consultation with religious and women's groups as it went beyond an African Union protocol on women's rights which only backs abortion in cases of sexual assault and in medical emergencies. Under Sierra Leone's current constitution, the president cannot veto a bill which received a two-thirds majority in parliament, our reporter says. The speaker of the house could sign the Safe Abortion Act into law, but our correspondent says he is highly unlikely to do so as he comes from the president's party. Mr Koroma met leaders from the Inter Religious Council of Sierra Leone (IRCSL), who all oppose abortion, in January, saying they \"represent a huge constituency across the country\". Catholic Archbishop Tamba Charles, vice-president of IRCSL, reiterated their view at summit on the issue later in the month declaring: \"No life can be destroyed on the basis of choice as life is sacred. \"If they want to fight for the right of women, then let them be provided with the required medical facilities that will help reduce maternal mortality rate in the country,\" Sierra Leone's Politico news website quotes him as saying.

Russian Yurchikhin and American Nyberg have both been into space before. Italian Parmitano is a first-timer. They arrived at the orbiting platform five hours and 46 minutes later. Their Soyuz capsule was using a new flight profile that dramatically reduces the rendezvous time from the traditional two days. It is technically more difficult and requires some very precise orbital adjustments, but it is deemed to be easier on the crew because it means they do not have to spend so long inside their cramped vehicle. Leak and pressure checks were conducted following docking at the station, with a hatch opening at 04:14 GMT. The trio, whose designation is Expedition 36, were greeted with hugs and smiles by the three individuals already on the ISS - Russians Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin, and American Chris Cassidy. The new crew members will be given a week of light duties in which to acclimatise to their weightless surroundings. Work will then begin in earnest. Luca Parmitano's participation in this expedition is particularly notable. At 36, he is the youngest person to get a long-duration (six months) stay on the station. He is also the first of the European Space Agency's (Esa) new intake of astronauts to get a flight assignment. Selected in 2009, the former fighter pilot has a packed schedule ahead of him. ISS crews are now completing about 70 hours a week of science, conducting experiments that exploit the unique microgravity environment on the platform. Parmitano has a package of specific European activities to work through, which cover fields as diverse as fluid physics and materials science. The Italian will see all of the vehicles now used to service the station come and go during his time in orbit, including possibly the new Cygnus freighter which is made in part in the Italian city of Turin. He is also scheduled to make two spacewalks to work on the exterior of the platform. \"I've dreamt of doing that. Being an astronaut is about walking in space. For me, they are one and the same thing,\" he told BBC News. One of the spacewalks will help prepare the ISS for the arrival of Russia's big science laboratory, which will grow the 420-tonne complex still further. The lab will come up with Europe's major robotic contribution to the platform - a large arm that is able to move around the station to conduct work wherever it is needed.

Italian chefs have prepared a range of special astronaut foods for him, including lasagne and risotto. These will be delivered to the ISS in the coming weeks on the European robotic freighter Albert Einstein. Fyodor Yurchikhin, Karen Nyberg and Luca Parmitano are due back on Earth on 10 November.

The initiative was set up by five charitable trusts, including Comic Relief, to discourage the cutting of girls' sexual organs. As well as funding the work of dozens of community groups, the money also paid for the training of more than 6,000 teachers and healthcare staff in how to spot and respond to the illegal act of female genital mutilation. Under the scheme, people were encouraged to work within their own communities. For example, a Somali elder in Bolton recruited other men in his community to emphasise the need to protect their daughters.

The news that Richmond's Orange Tree Theatre had lost all of its funding came on new artistic director Paul Miller's first official day in the job. The funding represents almost a quarter of the theatre's income. \"I think the big, national contradictory pressures that are on the Arts Council were just so great that something had to give - and on that occasion it was us,\" Mr Miller told the BBC. \"I think there is an element of rebalancing out of London. Perhaps there was a perception about the kind of work that the Orange Tree was doing that was not easy to shift. \"Once upon a time, the Orange Tree was a fledgling start-up company that had its first Arts Council funding. For new younger companies to get into the system, it means that existing organisations cannot simply take for granted that they will continue to be regularly funded.\" He said talks with the Arts Council would continue while until he developed a new business model. \"There are still many ways in which we can continue to take wonderful theatre in our lovely space. We just have to find a financially different way of doing it.\" Salford's The Lowry arts centre had a 22% funding drop to \u00a3800,000 per year. But it also received a \u00a33m capital grant from the Arts Council and a \u00a31 million private donation - the largest in its 14-year history. \"It's a mixed result for us but one that we're broadly pleased with,\" said chief executive Julia Fawcett. The Arts Council funding currently represents about 6% of The Lowry's total budget, and this will drop to about 4% from 2015. \"It means we'll have to recalibrate, refocus and work harder,\" said Ms Fawcett. She didn't see \"too many seismic shifts\" in the way funding had changed outside the capital. \"The shift out of London is so marginal it hardly bears attention.

There were probably 20 to 30 of of us, including the French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade and his family. We didn't know anything.\" Anglade, who injured his hand as he tried to activate the train's alarm, has also spoken about members of train staff locking themselves in a private cabin, complaining that they could have led passengers to a luggage area in another part of the train.

There was no response.\" Agnes Ogier, the boss of Thalys, has said there will be an internal investigation and the staff involved will be asked to \"explain their behaviour during this dramatic event\". Jamie Robinson says after 10 terrifying minutes a man entered their carriage and explained there had been a man with a gun but the situation was now under control. Afterwards he learned this was Anthony Sadler, one of the American passengers who helped overpower the attacker. \"The relief just exploded. We were all in such painful shock,\" he recalls. After learning they were safe Jamie Robinson and other passengers in his coach remained where they were, in numb silence, until they reached Arras station where the suspect, Ayoub El-Khazzani, a 25-year-old Moroccan, was arrested. Four days on from the traumatic events, Mr Robinson still can't understand why the train staff did nothing to help the passengers. He even believes the three staff may have jumped off the train as it slowly moved into Arras station. \"They must have some responsibility, not to attack the attacker but some training to alert passengers. There was nothing. They got out, they saved themselves.

{"text": "A court hearing to decide how long Ciar\u00e1n Maxwell will serve in prison is under way at the Old Bailey. In February, Maxwell, 31, admitted a number of offences, including bomb-making and storing stolen military weapons. The County Antrim man also pleaded guilty to drugs and fraud charges. The hearing is expected to take up to three days. Maxwell is not in court, but is appearing via video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes. According to the charge details, he had a stash of explosives in 12 purpose-built hides in England and Northern Ireland. DNA evidence found at one of the County Antrim hides led to Maxwell's arrest. On Wednesday, the court heard that Maxwell told police he had taken a member of the Continuity IRA to a hide where he had stashed pipe bombs in Northern Ireland. The court was told the man he took to the hide was Niall Lehd, convicted in 2014 of possession of an explosive substance with intent to endanger life. Maxwell, who is originally from Larne, had handwritten \"to-do lists\" mentioning \"targets, dummy runs and recces\" and a number of towns in Northern Ireland. The exact details were redacted by the court, but the targets included a Territorial Army centre and substations. There was also reference to a loyalist group, the need to notify news agencies and the words \"test pipe bomb and car bomb\". In one of his hides, Maxwell placed a modified booby-trapped torch which, when armed, would explode if turned on. Maxwell lived in Exminster, County Devon, and was based with 40 Commando in Taunton, Somerset. He never served in Northern Ireland. He was arrested last August and a search near Exeter found hides with a range of explosive substances, as well as ammunition, weapons and tools for making bombs. Along with the 14 pipe bombs, the court heard Maxwell also stashed: . On Wednesday, prosecutor Richard Whittam QC told the court: \"Across 14 of the locations involved in the investigation, Mr Maxwell had in his possession, or had constructed, 14 pipe bombs... four have been deployed in Northern Ireland. \"It is our case that some of the items inevitably must have been taken from the UK to Northern Ireland by this defendant.\" He added: \"It may be that, when travelling between England and the UK, bearing in mind the identity cards he would have had, and his position, his passage would have been easier than others to take items with him.\" The court heard dissident republicans have carried out more than 160 terrorist attacks since 2010, including the deployment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) such as pipe bombs. Mr Whittam said: \"Whilst attacks are mainly directed at members of the police, military and prison service, the nature of the attacks leaves members of the public at risk.\" The court heard that Maxwell \"appeared shocked\" when he was arrested. After his arrest, drugs were found in locker at the camp, including herbal cannabis, cannabis resin, and hallucinogenic drugs DMT and LSD. In March 2016, police said bomb-making parts had been found in barrels hidden in a wooded area in Carnfunnock County Park in County Antrim. Two months later, another \"terrorist hide\" was found in Capanagh Forest, also near Larne. Police described it as one of the most significant arms finds in recent years.

{"text": "The national chain, based in Langholm, is accused of committing the offence on two occasions in 2014. A trial began at Dumfries Sheriff Court last month but reporting restrictions prevented publicity. Lawyers for the company argued it could have affected witnesses and voiced concerns about the business impact but the ban has now been overturned. The alleged offences, brought under the Textile Products Regulations 2012, are said to have taken place at the company's store in Church Place, Dumfries, one of 265 high street shops. When the trial began at Dumfries Sheriff Court on 15 September, Susan Duff QC, for the accused, argued against an application on behalf of the BBC and ITV Border to revoke the ban, arguing that publicity could affect the evidence of witnesses who are yet to come to court. She also said: \"The accused has a legitimate concern about its business and employees. \"Now is the busiest time of year for the purchase of cashmere.\" She said reporting that scarves were not 100% cashmere could be \"prejudicial to the legitimate interests\" of the firm. But Ronnie Clancy QC, for the BBC, argued that this being \"the busiest time of year for Christmas orders\" was simply a reputational issue, not covered by the Contempt of Court Act under which the ban was made. Sheriff George Jamieson agreed to revoke the interim order he had previously made, and allowed the case to be reported. Previously, Alison Irving, 52, a trading standards officer at Dumfries and Galloway Council, told the court she had test purchased a blue tartan scarf in February 2014 and a red one four months later. Both scarves were reduced to \u00c2\u00a330 from \u00c2\u00a360 and were labelled as 100% Lochmere cashmere, the court heard. Ms Irving later cut the scarves into pieces, bagged and sealed them and sent them off to be analysed at two different test labs - SGS UK and Intertek UK. It emerged that she was acting on information from the Cashmere and Camelhair Manufacturers Institute (CCMI). On receiving reports back from the test labs, Ms Irving said she sent a letter in August 2014 cautioning EWM. She said she notified the business that one scarf had been found to contain 84.4% cashmere, while the other was found to have 61.6% cashmere, with the remainder made up of other wool fibres. Under cross-examination from Ms Duff, the witness said it was \"odd\" that the results received back from each of the labs had been different from each other. \"They were different from each other but neither said they were 100%,\" she said. The witness confirmed that after sending EWM a sample, the company sent back results from another test lab showing that both scarves were found to be 100% cashmere. Ms Duff also challenged the evidence of a textile analyst Liqin Zhang who gave evidence saying she identified wool and yak in the scarf samples. Ms Duff told Ms Zhang that EWM had sent a DNA tested 100% cashmere sample for her to analyse in August 2016. The lawyer said the fabric had been subject to the same processes and dyed the same colour as the red scarf sample previously tested. Ms Duff told Ms Zhang: \"You identified that 100% cashmere sample as 85% cashmere and 15% unidentifiable fibres. \"The issue is with your identification and not with the product, isn't it?\" Ms Zhang replied: \"If the fibre structure is damaged I have to report it as unidentifiable, I can't just guess.\" Ms Duff continued: \"You couldn't identify fibres that were 100% cashmere, that's down to your ability?\" Ms Zhang replied: \"That's my decision on what my observation is. I'm not saying I'm perfect.\" The trial continues.", "summary": "A sheriff has lifted a ban on reporting the trial of retailer EWM, accused of falsely claiming cashmere scarves were 100% cashmere.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states the ban was lifted by the sheriff but the source text indicates the ban was lifted by the Dumfries Sheriff Court."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 1346}

Mr Benn added that Mr Hammond should \"think more carefully about what he says\". \"We need responsibility and international leadership from this government, not scaremongering,\" he said. \"Those fleeing Syria are desperate refugees from a country being torn apart by war.\" Speaking during a visit to Singapore, Mr Hammond said: \"So long as the European Union's laws are the way they are, many of them will only have to set foot in Europe to be pretty confident that they will never be returned to their country of origin. \"Now, that is not a sustainable situation because Europe can't protect itself and preserve its standard of living and social infrastructure, if it has to absorb millions of migrants from Africa.\" He said the problem had to ultimately be resolved by being able to return those who are not entitled to claim asylum back to their countries of origin - something Mr Hammond described as \"our number one priority\".

The plans were announced on the 50th anniversary of the release of the single, which was a double-A side with Penny Lane, reaching number two in the UK charts and number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the USA. The original home in Woolton was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced with a smaller building.

However, should driverless vehicles make up between 50% and 75% of cars, DfT researchers say they will reduce congestion. The average time spent delayed on city roads at rush hour will fall by 12.4% when 25% of vehicles are driverless. The DfT said early models of the vehicles acted more cautiously and the result could be a \"potential decrease in effective capacity\" on motorways and A roads. But as more people adopted the technology and it became common place on the country's road network, the study found that congestion could be cut by 40%. Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: \"There's a prize to be had in terms of swifter, safer journeys, but the transition to that world will be challenging. \"There are around 32 million conventional cars on the UK's roads - as driverless cars come in, traffic flow could initially get worse rather than better, potentially for many years. \"Much will depend on how an autonomous car's parameters are set and just how defensively these vehicles will be programmed to drive.\" The study used software to map out the effects of the cars on the road network.

{"text": "The cardboard boxes also include a mattress and can be used for babies to sleep in as an alternative to a crib. The Scottish government hopes the boxes will help ensure every baby is given the best possible start in life. Baby boxes are already given out by some health authorities in other parts of the UK. But the Scotland-wide rollout, which follows successful pilot projects in Orkney and Clackmannanshire, is the first time they will be available to all expecting mothers in one part of the country. The Scottish government has given assurances that all of its baby boxes meet the highest UK safety standards for sleeping, with safe sleep guidance provided in a leaflet inside the box and safety guidelines also printed on the lid. It follows concerns raised earlier this month by cot death charity The Lullaby Trust, whose chief executive Francine Bates said she was unhappy with some boxes being marketed as products which will reduce infant mortality and SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). Lynsay Allan, executive director of the Scottish Cot Death Trust, said: \"I am encouraged by the fact that Scotland's baby box scheme is prompting parents to think about their sleeping practices. \"While the proven safest place for a baby to sleep is in a cot, crib or Moses basket, I also recognise that the box can be used as a safe sleep space for newborn babies, particularly where families may have no alternative and where they might otherwise unsafely share their bed or sleep on a sofa or chair with their baby.\" Expectant mothers due to give birth on or after 15 August have been able to register to receive their baby box at midwife appointments since June. The boxes will be sent to the mother's home address or another preferred location from today. From January of next year, the baby boxes will be delivered at least four weeks before the baby's due date. Colleen Groves, a mum-to-be who will be receiving one, told BBC Scotland: \"I really like the idea of it being a safe sleeping space. \"I would probably use it more during the day, rather than at night-time. I would use it as a sort of living space for putting down for naps during the day. \"I think it is really nice that every baby is being given the same start and being given the same things. \"It's up to the parents whether they take the box or not because you do register for it. It's up to each individual to decide whether they want to make use of it or not.\" Early Years Minister Mark McDonald said the Scottish government would continue to monitor feedback as the baby boxes reach more families, and would work with parents and healthcare professionals to keep the contents under review. And he said the boxes, which have largely been based on a similar scheme in Finland, were just one of a range of measures the government was using to help babies and parents thrive in the crucial early months. Scotland's chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said the boxes would also offer healthcare professionals a unique opportunity to introduce expectant parents to a wide range of health promotion information. Prof Russell Viner of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said child health in Scotland was among the worst in western Europe - with about 400 infants, children and young people dying each year, a significant number of which were potentially avoidable. But he said evidence into the effectiveness of baby boxes in reducing child mortality was \"limited\". Prof Viner added: \"Therefore the initiative must be carefully evaluated and delivered alongside other policies. \"These include ensuring universal early-years public health services such as health visitors are prioritised, supported and properly funded, with targeted help for children and families living in poverty. \"Combining these efforts will improve child health and help bring Scotland's mortality rates into line with the best performing countries in Europe.\" The Scottish government's poverty advisor, Naomi Eisenstadt, said that the boxes might be welcome for parents in poverty, but questioned whether offering them as a universal benefit was the best use of public money.", "summary": "Every mother-to-be in Scotland is to be given a \"baby box\" which can be used as a safe sleeping space.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2881}

{"text": "They think it could be used to improve nutritional advice or in weight loss because people are notoriously bad at recording their own eating habits. The test, detailed in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, detects chemicals made as food is processed by the body. The research team believe it could be widely available within two years. The urine samples are analysed to determine the structure of the chemicals floating around in it using a technique called a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This gives clues to both recent meals and long term dietary habits. The results of your body processing fruit, vegetables, fish and different types of meat leave a distinct signature in the urine. Clues to the state of the body's metabolism and gut health can also be detected by investigating the chemicals in it. The test was developed by a collaboration between Imperial College London, Newcastle University and Aberystwyth University. Dr Isabel Garcia-Perez, one of the researchers at Imperial, said: \"This will eventually provide a tool for personalised dietary monitoring to help maintain a healthy lifestyle. \"We're not at the stage yet where the test can tell us a person ate 15 chips yesterday and two sausages, but it's on the way.\" In trials, around 60% of people either under or over report what they are eating. Prof Gary Frost, another scientist at Imperial, said this could be the first independent test of what people munch on at home. He told the BBC News website: \"You can really tell whether someone's been following a healthy diet or not. \"The bigger you are the more likely you are to under-report what you eat. \"People find it difficult to open up to what types of foods they eat at home, which is a major problem.\" The researchers believe the test results could help combat people's obesity or risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Prof Frost said: \"If someone is very big and their profile says they're eating lots of energy dense foods like meat, then you can try to change that profile and then test them again later. \"It remains to be seen, but people might respond better to that and there is a desperate need for tools to help people change their diet.\" He says doing the test on large numbers of people would build up a picture of what the nation was really eating, which could be used to design better public health campaigns. The scientists were able to spot the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets after tests on 19 people who spent days eating a carefully controlled set of meals. Four diets of varying degrees of healthiness were given to the patients and their urine was sampled morning, noon and night. Dr Des Walsh, from the UK Medical Research Council, commented: \"Though this research is still in its early stages, it's grappling with essential methods in food and diet studies where advances are really needed. \"Measuring what we eat and drink more accurately will widen the benefits of nutrition research, developing better evidence-based interventions to improve an individual's health and reduce obesity.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "summary": "Scientists say they have developed a urine test that can tell whether a person is following a healthy or unhealthy diet.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2769}

{"text": "Earlier this week, a councillor in the Scottish Borders said she believed people were being short-changed by the rollout of the service. BT has said it has invested heavily in providing services in areas where it was not commercially viable to do so. It has also pointed out that there are a wide range of factors at play in determining the speeds received. The BBC Scotland news website asked for your experiences of the service in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway. Iain Rennie emailed: I live in the village of Ednam. Barely 2 miles from Kelso. We get a max of 1.5Mb. It is frustrating in the extreme to see constant TV adverts for high speed broadband when ours is too slow to stream or watch BBC iPlayer etc. As far as I'm aware there is no date or plan to upgrade this area. Byron Raistrick, of Ruthwell, emailed: Since the announcement by the Scottish Executive that the initiative was up and running, I've not seen any evidence of the \u00c2\u00a3126m being distributed fairly and efficiently to the areas that need it most - rural locations. Major cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh would have been upgraded as a matter of course by BT Openzone to cater for the businesses there and in turn the residential areas would have benefited, yet (they) have been upgraded first with the money. Linda Lonsdale emailed: We pay extra money to get superfast broadband and it is not any faster load of rubbish conned again. Susan Cook emailed: Broadband speed in our village 0.9Mb and sometimes even lower. We have been told by BT that it will be four to six years before we get anything better! And we pay the same as all their other customers. There are people living in the Borders other than in Melrose and Galashiels yet no consideration is given to them. Siobhan Liehne emailed: We live on the Mellerstain Estate near Gordon. We keep reading of ministers complaining that constituents in some Borders areas are \"only getting 2Mbps\". Frankly I would give my eyeteeth for that kind of speed. We get 0.7 Mbps if we are lucky and sometimes it drops out altogether. Then we have to see signs up telling us that towns only a very short distance away are getting superfast. When we ring BT to try and find out when things are going to improve we get someone in India telling us that it must be our computer. If it is, then it's every computer on the estate, no matter how new it may be. Andrew Gray emailed: I live near Chirnside in the Scottish Borders which is enabled for fibre broadband. However only those residents who live within a mile of the cabinet can get anything like the speeds advertised. My house is two and a half miles from the cabinet so the fibre signal does not reach it at all. According to most comparison websites (including BT's) I can receive broadband speeds of up to 40Mb but in practice I get just over 2Mb, if I'm lucky. There should be further scrutiny of how public money has been spent on improving broadband services, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone can benefit in the future. Henry Sinclair emailed: I live in Earlston and have what the major players call \"superfast\" broadband - ie fibre to the cabinet, which is 100m away or just over 200m of copper wire. The actual speeds I get vary between 20 and 70Mbps download and 15 to 20Mbps upload. My grandson who lives no more than 400m from me and 300m from a cabinet can only achieve a max of 6Mbps and pays the same as me. Copper is a 19th century answer to a 21st century question but BT continues to squander taxpayers' money on using it to provide an inadequate or in some cases no service while the solution is staring it in the face. As the internet moves from a consumer model to an interactive one the pathetic download speeds and risible upload speeds will hold us all back and eventually our interconnection system will have to be re-engineered using fibre. Why not do it now rather than throwing billions at a known fatally flawed approach? Brian Telfer emailed: I have had issues since BT started to enable the Hawick exchange well over a year ago. I was getting better speed and reliability before the exchange was enabled for fibre. I am now on fibre at double the price, with continual buffering drops in service and regular visits from engineers who contradict each other - speed can be from 1.52Mb to 20Mb - not the 52 Mbps I am paying for. Uploads are a joke - I now use my phone tethered to the computer to upload anything! Peter Dorward emailed: I read your report with interest particularly the part that referred to over \u00c2\u00a38m being invested in super fast broadband by SBC and that 94% of homes will have it. At the moment why not focus attention on getting something like 'normal' broadband speeds to all households. We have struggled at trying to conduct work when at home when only being able to access broadband internet with speeds that are barely any better than a dial up service! Any pressure that can be brought to get us to first base is welcomed. Carole emailed: We live in Bonnington Road in Peebles in a modern house and our broadband speed is very poor we are with BT and get 2Mb which is a joke. Believe one of our neighbours gets better speed. When you try to raise it with BT you don't get anywhere. Poor show ... what's fibre optic? Even a bit better speed would be appreciated fibre optic is a dream for us. David Jeffrey emailed: I work in broadband provision for local councils in the south of the country.

He said reports of his remarks had been \"twisted\" to suggest a focus on race. He had simply been proposing derelict premises should be converted, he said. The comments were made as Mr Williams was outlining a government proposal to protect community pubs. The plan involves changing the law to prevent places listed as assets of community value being demolished or having their use changed without planning permission. Some campaigners had called for the government to go further and impose a blanket ban on the redevelopment of all pubs without planning permission. Arguing against a blanket ban, Mr Williams told MPs: \"In my own constituency, lots of pubs have closed - but it is usually because of demographic change. \"Some parts of my constituency, which had a 'white working-class community' 20 or 30 years ago, are now populated primarily by recently arrived Somalis and other people. \"Obviously the pubs in those areas have closed, and some have been converted to other uses, but some of them are still derelict. \"What the government is proposing is to look at the public houses that are genuinely popular and valued by the community now, giving them protection that is already allowed in the Localism Act and further enhancing that protection in terms of the planning laws, saying you cannot convert this pub into another use or demolish it without planning permission.\" Some reports, including one in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, with the headline \"'Somali immigrants' cause pub closures\", had taken his comments out of context, Mr Williams said. \"There was no value judgement in what I said.

{"text": "An assessment of how much each Scottish firm will pay in non-domestic rates is under way, to take effect from April. Tory leader Ruth Davidson has written to Nicola Sturgeon calling for an \"urgent review\" of the process. The first minister has said all businesses will have the chance to appeal the final valuations. And she said that 100,000 small firms would be lifted out of having to pay rates altogether via the small business bonus scheme, claiming Scotland has \"the most competitive business rates regime in the whole UK\". The revaluation of how much firms have to pay is being carried out by independent assessors, funded by local councils. The Scottish Assessors Association has published provisional values, with the finalised figures to be sent out in March before they take effect in the new financial year. The last revaluation in Scotland was carried out in 2010. The Conservatives said they had been \"inundated with letters from businesses across Scotland who are facing huge increases in their rates\", claiming some faced having to pay four times more than they did previously. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has also requested a meeting with Ms Sturgeon to discuss what they called \"crippling\" rates increases, while the Scottish Chambers of Commerce have also raised concerns. Ms Davidson said: \"These shops, hotels and restaurants are vital to our economy, providing much needed jobs in many areas of the country, and we cannot afford to see them simply go out of business. \"That's why I've called on Nicola Sturgeon to listen to the voices of these businesses and the Scottish Tourism Alliance and launch an urgent review into these rate increases. \"The amounts that are being asked for are clearly unsustainable and if immediate action is not taken then we risk seeing a huge amount of damage done to our economy.\" A review group led by former RBS chairman Ken Barclay has been set up to \"enhance and reform\" the business rates system in Scotland, although it will not report back until after the new rates have come into force. Ms Davidson and Ms Sturgeon have clashed over the matter in the Holyrood chamber in recent weeks, with the first minister noting that \"competitive business taxes are important\". She said: \"The final valuations will be issued later this year and all businesses will have the opportunity to appeal if they think that their valuation is wrong. \"We have the most competitive business rates regime in the whole UK, with 100,000 small businesses having been lifted out of business rates altogether. \"We have a tourism sector that, thanks to the good work of those in it, is booming, and the employment level is rising much faster than it is in the rest of the UK.

{"text": "The moneyed men were from the town's trawling fleets and made their living working \"at the hardest job in the world\". After about three weeks toiling in the fishing grounds, they would return for just three days on land to spend their hard-earned cash before going back to sea. Their lives and other aspects of the booming Grimsby fishing industry of the 1950s are being marked in an exhibition called Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll. Local history enthusiast Alf Ludlam, 71, said: \"The men would stand out in what almost amounted to a uniform. \"They would wear pale grey or blue suits with lots of pleats in the back of the jackets and baggy trousers.\" Mr Ludlam, a museum volunteer with Grimsby Council, said the suits were a fashion statement but also a way of saying \"look at my money\" because the trawlermen could afford to buy a extravagant quantity of cloth. And the men wore open-necked shirts as \"however cold it was in town, it was never as cold as on a trawler off Iceland,\" he added . Mr Ludlam remembers watching the men roaming his home town during the 1950s, a time when \"thanks to fishing Grimsby was making more money than ever\". At its peak in that decade, Mr Ludlam said Grimsby was \"the largest fishing port in the world\". The vibrancy of the fishing trade had a spin-off for the rest of the town until the mid-1970s. It was a great period to grow up in Grimsby, Mr Ludlam said, because \"everything was in the melting pot\". \"Fishing was Grimsby's raison d'etre - no fishing, no Grimsby, \" he added. The heyday for the trade lasted about 20 years but the reliance on fishing proved to be a problem for the town as the trawler fleet contracted during, and after, the two decades of the Cod Wars. Iceland started extending its territorial limit around the island to exclude foreign vessels from the water it claimed as its own. The limit was extended on three occasions between 1958 and 1976, each time forcing British fishing vessels further offshore. The limit was finally extended 200 miles off Iceland. This led to confrontations at sea between the Icelandic coastguard and trawlers from Grimsby and Hull. Several ships were even rammed as trawlers continued to try to fish within the new limit. The neighbouring fishing ports of Grimsby and Hull vied with each other in the size and skill of their trawler fleet, and the quality and quantity of fish landed. Mr Ludlam said the ports had \"always been at daggers drawn\" and their fishing fleets were a source of civic pride. He said the collapse of the trawler industry in Grimsby mirrored the similar economic and social struggle former mining towns experienced after the pits closed. The two industries of fishing and mining were also linked by the level of danger encountered. Mr Ludlam said: \"Fishing was the most dangerous - when you set sail you didn't know if you were going to come back.\" The free exhibition Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll is open until Sunday January 13 at the Fishing Heritage Centre in Grimsby .", "summary": "In the 1950s, Grimsby's trawlermen wore suits almost as big as their boats.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary claims that the trawlermen's suits were almost as big as their boats, but the source text does not make this comparison or suggest such a size for the suits."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3549}
{"text": "Since April, convicted criminals in England and Wales have had to pay a charge of between \u00a3150 and \u00a31,200 towards the cost of their case. But Mr Gove said \"while the intention behind the policy was honourable in reality that intent has fallen short\". MPs had called for it to be axed and the Magistrates Association said the decision was \"tremendously welcome\". The charge is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty. It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases. In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals \"pay their way\". But MPs on the Justice Committee published a report in November in which they said the fee, which is not means-tested, created \"serious problems\" and was often \"grossly disproportionate\". The cross-party group's chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said they evidence they had received raised \"grave misgivings\" about the fee's benefits and whether it was \"compatible with the principles of justice\". He said it created \"perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs\". Mr Gove, Mr Grayling's successor as justice secretary, announced it was being dropped, during a meeting of the Magistrates' Association Council. The Magistrates' Association's national chairman, Malcolm Richardson said: \"This is an enormous success for the MA (Magistrates' Association) but most importantly for justice in our criminal courts system. \"In my 26 years as a magistrate I have never seen such a powerful reaction from my colleagues on the bench and Michael Gove's announcement is therefore tremendously welcome.\" Justice Select Committee chairman Bob Neill said it was \"good\" Mr Gove was \"willing to respond so swiftly to take account of the inquiry we carried out and the evidence submitted to us\". \"We will watch with interest the review which Michael Gove has announced into the whole panoply of financial impositions on offenders,\" he added.

Its chief executive, Frances Crook said: \"This is a victory for justice. It augurs well for changes being made to the courts and penal systems, which both need radical reform.\" Meanwhile, Labour said it had warned from the start that the \"mandatory nature of the fee could lead to miscarriages of justice\" and welcomed that it \"has finally been scrapped\".

The group were allegedly promised $250,000 (\u00c2\u00a3192,000) to kill Nemtsov. They all denied the charges. Nemtsov's relatives fear that whoever ordered the murder will never be found. Russian authorities are still looking for another Chechen said to be behind the killing, Ruslan Mukhudinov. He believed to have fled abroad. But lawyers for Nemtsov's family have said the investigators have exaggerated Mr Mukhudinov's role and \"the masterminds are high-ranking people\". The jury in Moscow convicted the five men after more than eight months of hearings. Zaur Dadayev is former member of an elite military unit. He was under the command of pro-Moscow's Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia's Chechen Republic in the North Caucasus. The other four defendants are brothers Anzor Gubashev and Shadid Gubashev, Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov. A sixth man, Beslan Shabanov, died while he was being detained in Chechnya. Nemtsov served as first deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, and later became a vocal critic of President Putin. The 55-year-old was shot dead on 27 February 2015 on his way from a restaurant in central Moscow. Earlier that day he was interviewed on a liberal radio station, in which he had called on listeners to join a rally. At the time, Nemtsov was working on a report examining Russia's alleged role in the conflict in Ukraine. President Putin called the murder \"vile and cynical\" and vowed to hold those responsible to account. Russia has seen several killings of high-profile politicians and journalists in recent years. But the country has a long history of prosecuting alleged hit-men and failing to follow the chain of command to discover who ordered the murder, correspondents say. It took the 12 jury members more than 12 hours to reach their verdict. They spent it in a closed room in one corner of the military courthouse with a guard posted outside the window. But when they finally filed back into court, it was to pronounce every one of the accused guilty. In each case they ruled by a clear majority. Standing opposite them inside a glass cage, surrounded by armed police and a Rottweiler, the men from Chechnya listened in silence, looking relaxed and even smiling as they had for much of this trial. There was speculation that one of the accused, Khamzat Bakhayev, might be acquitted for lack of evidence. When the jury found him guilty too, his wife burst into tears.

But the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra. Griffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done. Any fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost. Tailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base. Whatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another. In the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains. Facilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks. \"Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn't like to do roadwork,\" says Griffin, 38. \"So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard.\" Two pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery. Griffin explains why McGregor's typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense. \"He's been here once or twice a day for six weeks,\" adds Griffin. \"Training at the time you fight is under appreciated. When do you work out the best, after being up for 12 hours or three or four hours? He primes his body to do that, which is intelligent.\" We are taken to meet UFC flyweight Joe Benevidez, who is receiving treatment from director of physical therapy Heather Linden. Linden left a role at the USA's Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs to be here. She jokes when explaining how even the toughest UFC fighters can struggle on a pilates ball when she isolates their weakest muscles in order to highlight where work is needed. \"What's been a shock is how little access to services these athletes have had in the past,\" she says. \"It's amazing how some of them have never had medical guidance for preventative measures. \"I've had to build trust. I had a guy come in here and tell me he couldn't feel his left arm but he was going to fight. He was scared of telling people in the event he was pulled from competing but with work we restored him to full functionality in two weeks.\" Former UFC welterweight Dan Hardy is part of the tour. The Nottingham-born 35-year-old describes the facilities as \"night and day\" to what he used. \"My life would be different now,\" he tells the group. \"I used to work with friends for treatment, driving around for different things I needed.\" Despite all the technology in what feels like the slickest of finishing schools, MMA critics still exist. Perhaps blighted by images of the ground and pound or blood-stained faces they question the morality of the sport. But UFC's growth shows no sign of relenting. The company was sold for $4.2bn in 2016 and listening to Griffin it is obvious this is a sport with vision. Mapping the layout of the Institute saw the UFC research facilities at the likes of Man City, the Phoenix Suns basketball team and the USA Olympic team base. Habits were observed, such as an athlete's occasional tendency to neglect post-workout nutrition if access to it was not made easy. Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team. \"We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,\" adds Griffin. \"A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that. \"Every sport taxes the human body a certain way. The needs and demands change but the impact on the body and the recovery needed is very similar.\" Media playback is not supported on this device .

The study, which involved excavated animal remains and the examination of other historical evidence, could give fresh insights into ancient farming elsewhere. The University of the Highlands and Islands, which did the research, said these other places could include other Scottish islands and Scandinavia. The archaeologists said the good condition of the livestock at Earl's Bu gave an \"overall impression\" of an organised system of pastoral farming on the land. Herds of sheep and cattle were pastured and fattened up in established fields or upland areas, they said. This suggests that an elite group of people controlled the land in the form of manorial estates from the Viking period onwards.

{"text": "Pembrolizumab is a treatment for advanced skin cancer and is the first medicine to be approved through the Early Access to Medicines scheme (EAMS), launched in England last April. The idea is to get pioneering drugs to severely ill patients much sooner. Drugs signed off through EAMS have been scrutinised by regulators, weighing the risks and benefits. A green light by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) means doctors anywhere in the UK can prescribe the drug in question before normal licensing procedures - which can take years - are complete. Melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the UK and kills more than 2,000 people in Britain each year. Damage to the skin by the sun's harmful UV rays increases your risk of developing this cancer. While advanced melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may not be curable, targeted treatment can ease symptoms and may extend life. Clinical trials of pembrolizumab, which is injected into the bloodstream, suggest it has great promise for treating advanced disease. The treatment is considered a \"next generation\" drug in cancer care, stimulating the body's immune system to fight the disease. It blocks a biological pathway that the cancer uses to disguise itself from attack. Clinical trials are still under way, although the drug has already received a licence in the US for treating advanced melanoma. Until now, UK patients would only have been able to get pembrolizumab if they were on a clinical trial. Another government scheme in England, known as the The Cancer Drugs Fund, pays for cancer drugs that have already been licensed but not yet approved by the NHS watchdog NICE. MHRA chief executive Dr Ian Hudson said: \"We are delighted to issue the first positive Early Access to Medicines Scheme scientific opinion. \"The scientific opinion describes the risks and benefits of the medicine and the context for its use, supporting the prescriber and patient to make a decision on whether to use the medicine before its licence is approved.\" Emma Greenwood of Cancer Research UK said: \"Pembrolizumab is another example of the great progress we've made in developing immune treatments for cancer, so it's encouraging to see it being made available to patients earlier. \"NICE and the Cancer Drugs Fund only look at licensed drugs, so it's a step in the right direction in terms of patients getting access to new treatments faster.

Mrs Foster added: \"If people are going to vote for us, they need to have confidence in us.\" On Friday, the Assembly Commission and the Stormont expenses watchdog issued a joint statement on expenses payments. It said the two bodies are committed to working together to sort out the differences. In her speech to DUP members in Cookstown, County Tyrone, Mrs Foster expressed frustration that the issue was preventing her from communicating her vision for Northern Ireland. She said that she left the stability of a career in the legal profession \"because [she] believed in a cause\". \"I wanted to make Northern Ireland a better place.

{"text": "This Central American nation has often been in the middle of events with an impact far beyond its borders, from the engineering marvel that is the Panama Canal to the country's many political storms. Even so, people here have reacted with surprise - and indignation - after seeing their country's name linked to a hashtag that is shaking the world. For many locals, to talk about #PanamaPapers is in itself an injustice, as the name tarnishes the whole country with an alleged complicity in international tax evasion. They claim the accusations should instead be directed at a minuscule segment of their society. And anyway, they insist, the Panamanian companies involved were not doing anything different to firms in other financial capitals across the world. Panama is indeed a large and sophisticated offshore financial centre, whose companies help manage, in one way or another, large fortunes from all corners of the planet. But how does all of that money impact the everyday life of normal Panamanians? For a visitor, the prosperity of parts of the country is evident from the moment the plane flies over the capital, affording the first glimpse of Panama City from above. The city centre is so ostentatious that a Trump luxury hotel tower, 284 metres high and until 2012 the tallest building in Latin America, goes almost unnoticed among the dozens of skyscrapers crowding the horizon. Some people say it reminds them of Dubai, others say it looks like Miami. Panama City has done a good job in attracting cash to the country, home to just four million people and with relatively few natural resources other than its geographic location. The financial sector is key to the country's wealth, representing around 7% of GDP. And in a business where reputation is everything, many fear the effect the scandal could have on the industry's future growth. But Rafael, the taxi driver who takes me from the airport into the city centre, does not necessarily see it as his problem. He views it as a quarrel among elites. \"It is a white people's dance,\" he says disdainfully. He will not give me his full name, objecting that \"you never know who you are talking to\". But after a few minutes of conversation, he acknowledges his own life has been closely affected by the financial industry's ups and downs. He says he worked with one of the many Western banks that came to Panama during the 1970s boom, when Latin America was awash in petrodollars and the country helped manage many of the region's fortunes. But in the 1980s the petrodollars vanished. Panama was stigmatised as a money laundering centre for drug cartels, the bank left, and he ended up without a job. The financial sector eventually recovered and is now a central part of the economy, together with the Panama Canal, helping the country become more prosperous than most of its neighbours. With this wellbeing threatened, it is no wonder that political and business leaders in Panama treat the scandal as little less than an act of foreign aggression against the nation. La Estrella, one of the main local newspapers, carried a front page headline claiming that \"The Panama Papers are a global attack against the financial system\". \"The criticism Panama is getting is unfair. It is media sensationalism,\" Gian Castillero, an adviser to the foreign ministry, says. This week's revelations on the mechanisms used by the rich and famous to hide their fortunes refer to multiple jurisdictions, he claims, but the world is only focusing on one: Panama. \"There is no supervision problem in the government of Panama,\" he insists, adding that the country has submitted to several international benchmarking processes on its standards. \"There is a commitment to transparency.\" On social media, some Panamanians have undertaken a likely quixotic crusade to change the #PanamaPapers hashtag to one that is less compromising of their country's reputation.", "summary": "The Panama Papers scandal is not the first time Panama has been in the news.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary implies that Panama has often been in the news, but the source text does not discuss repeated media attention specifically."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 3300}

At least 89 people were killed in the incident in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun. Syria's government has repeatedly denied using any chemical weapons. The US has rejected the assertion, however, and on Friday it carried out a missile strike on the Shayrat airbase, where it said a Syrian Air Force jet that attacked Khan Sheikhoun with chemical weapons took off. President Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia, which says the Syrian jet had in fact hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions, denounced the \"illegal action\" by the US. A number of casualties were treated at hospitals in Turkey, which opposes Mr Assad, following last Tuesday's incident in neighbouring Idlib province. The World Health Organization said their apparent lack of external injuries and similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress, suggested they had been exposed to organophosphorus chemicals, a category that includes nerve agents. On Tuesday, Mr Akdag announced that a chemical known as isopropyl methyphosphonic acid (IMPA) had been \"identified in the blood and urine tests conducted on samples taken from the victims\". Once exposed to air and water, Sarin breaks down into IMPA and methylphosphonic acid (MPA). The UN concluded that rockets filled with sarin were fired at several rebel-held suburbs of Damascus in August 2013 after finding traces of IMPA in samples taken from the scene of the attack, which the US blamed on Syria's government. Earlier on Thursday, Russia's president urged the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to open a full investigation into last week's incident.

The benefit is intended to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt said she was reforming the PIP payments to \"restore the original aim of the benefit\" to make sure support was given to the most needy. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was \"furious\" about the proposed changes to PIPS, and said Labour would pressurise the government to reverse them in next month's Budget.

The bank said it expected investment in the resources sector, one of its biggest drivers of growth in recent times, to peak this year. It added that a rate cut would provide a boost to other areas of the economy and help sustain long-term growth. \"There has been a strengthening in consumption and a modest firming in dwelling investment, and prospects are for some increase in business investment outside the resources sector over the next year,\" the central bank said in a statement. \"These developments, some of which have been assisted by the reductions in interest rates that began 18 months ago, will all be helpful in sustaining growth.\" Australia's economic growth in recent years has been fuelled by the growing demand for its commodities, such as iron ore. That resulted in a resources boom in Australia and helped it sustain growth through the global financial crisis. However, as demand from key markets such as China has eased, there have been concerns that Australia's mining sector may see its growth slow. At the same time, many analysts have pointed out that other areas of the country's economy have not done so well, resulting in what many have termed a two-speed economy. To make matters worse, the Australian currency has strengthened - making its exports more expensive, as well as affecting sectors such as manufacturing and tourism. It rose nearly 9% against the US dollar between June 2012 and April 2013. Amid all these concerns, there have been calls for policymakers to take steps to help boost growth, especially in the non-mining sectors, to ensure that the economy continues to grow. Analysts said the cut in interest rates, which will help bring down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, will help to provide some relief to those sectors and allay fears of an economic slowdown. \"Commodity prices have fallen and inflation has come in less than expected, and of course the Australian dollar through all of that has remained surprisingly strong,\" said Shane Oliver, chief economist with AMP Capital Investors. \"I think it was appropriate for the Reserve to provide a bit more confidence [so that] when the mining investment boom starts to wane the rest of the economy will fill the gap.\" The Australian dollar weakened slightly, dipping 0.7% against the US dollar, after the rate cut was announced.

McGregor told the BBC the piece would \"break the rules\" of narrative ballet. The season will also include new works by Hofesh Shechter and Philip Glass, whose chamber opera The Trial is based on the Kafka novel of the same name. The Czech author's original story tells of Josef K, who is arrested and tried for a crime without ever being told what the charges against him are. Glass, who has worked with Music Theatre Wales on the piece, said: \"I think of my pocket operas as neutron bombs - small, but packing a terrific punch\". McGregor, who is the Royal Ballet's resident choreographer, said he had been inspired to apply Virginia Woolf's narrative style to full-length ballet. \"Her writing lends itself to the breaking of rules, in terms of how words are organised, or thoughts are organised. I thought that was a perfect filter to create something new.\" \"We're going to be able to find a way of mashing up, splicing and going back-and-forward through periods of time in a way that will hopefully be really evocative, and a different way of experiencing ballet\". Israeli choreographer Shechter is described by the ROH as \"one of the UK's most exciting contemporary artists\". However, The Guardian's dance critic, Judith Mackrell, has suggested his choreography is \"the physical and aesthetic opposite of the Royal's classical style\". The first collaboration between the two will be unveiled as part of a triple bill in March 2015. Other highlights include an evening of works by Frederick Ashton, founder choreographer of The Royal Ballet. The programme will feature Scenes de ballet, Ashton's own personal favourite amongst his works; Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan; A Month in the Country and Symphonic Variations, which he created for his muse Margot Fonteyn. Carlos Acosta's Don Quixote will be revived, while the Christmas production will be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which will also be screened live in cinemas on 16 December.

{"text": "Opposition councillors accused the ruling Labour group of \"arrogance\" and not listening to the public's concerns. The plans had also prompted protests outside the council's offices on Wednesday. Council leader Peter Marland said he was \"disappointed\" but would work with other parties to agree a new budget. The authority's provisional 2015-16 budget had included \u00a31.5m cuts to bus services, and reduced funding for the Citizens' Advice Bureau. Homeless shelters faced possible closure under the plans, and the removal of other funding could have forced some scout groups to shut down. Liberal Democrat leader, Douglas McCall, accused council leaders of refusing to listen to public concerns or engage with opposition parties. He described their approach to a public consultation as \"arrogant\". However, Mr Marland said a record consultation response showed the authority was listening. \"What we couldn't do is persuade enough opposition politicians that what we were doing was ultimately right,\" he said. Former Conservative group leader Andrew Geary said his party had predicted savings for five years and put forward a \"clear strategy\" for delivering them when it was in control. \"You simply can't amend something that is not built on a solid foundation and this budget is built on the sand and it will collapse and it won't deliver.\" The authority is set to meet again next week to discuss the revised proposals. Analysis . Paul Scoins, Political reporter, BBC Three Counties . After the political grandstanding comes the negotiation. Concessions will be made but the key sticking point of provision for homeless people will remain a subject for debate. The council will then need to agree that budget and, if they fail, the government will step in and act, most likely freezing the budget in its current state. More than \u00a390m needs to be saved over the next few years and Labour says difficult decisions are inevitable.

Timon admitted manslaughter but was cleared of murder at the Old Bailey. He was also given five years on extended licence as he was considered a \"significant risk\" to the public. Mr Dearlove died hours after the attack, which happened after he had struck up a friendly chat with the women, who had been out celebrating a birthday with Timon. How lives are devastated by a single blow . Timon demanded to know what they were discussing and told his victim \"if you don't get out of my face I will knock you out\", the court heard. He then punched Mr Dearlove in the side of the head with his left fist, sending him to the ground and knocking him out. A post-mortem examination found he died from bleeding to the brain. Judge Mark Dennis QC told Timon, who had a history of violence, Mr Dearlove had presented no threat and the punch was an \"unprovoked and gratuitous act\". \"This was a senseless death that occurred as a result of an act borne out of a flaw in your character which in the past has seen you display unnecessary violent conduct to others when, for reasons best known to you, you have become annoyed or wound yourself up,\" he said. \"Oliver Dearlove was a young man of fine character with a long and promising future ahead of him.

The nurse described him as the \"most gentle, kind and relaxed person I have ever known and a true gentleman which is why so many people liked him.\" She said the couple had been making plans for the future before the \"dreaded knock on our door\".

Kidnappings committed by a public security official, such as a member of the police or military, will be punished with up to 100 years in prison. Kidnappers will also have to pay heavy fines. In reality, few people ever receive sentences longer than 60 years for federal crimes, but kidnapping is considered in a separate category. The number of kidnappings reported to the police has risen dramatically in Mexico in recent years. In 2007, 438 kidnappings were reported, but the number had risen to almost 1,700 last year. And the government estimates the number of kidnappings reported to the police could be fewer than 2% of the total. If that is the case, the real number of abductions could be about 105,000 per year. Analysts say accurate figures are hard to come by, as many abductions only last for hours or a few days until the victims empty their bank accounts at gunpoint or pay a ransom. Most are never reported to the authorities for fear of reprisals from the criminal gang which carried out the kidnapping.

He also said it would be \"very difficult\" for David Cameron to remain leader if the UK voted to leave the EU. Vote Leave said it was saddened at \"the level of debate\" from the Remain camp. Mr Johnson has previously said voters want proper debate and to hear about the issues, \"not personal attacks\". The UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June. The Conservative Party is deeply split over the the issue, with David Cameron and most of his cabinet campaigning for a Remain vote but about half of the MPs supporting an EU exit. The debate inside the party has turned increasingly acrimonious, with former deputy prime minister and pro-Remain campaigner Lord Heseltine recently accusing Mr Johnson of losing his judgement over the EU. Lord Patten, Tory party chairman from 1990 to 1992, added to that criticism of the former London mayor, in an interview with Newsnight's David Grossman on Friday. \"Boris just makes it up as he goes along, and you come across people like that,\" he said. \"There's a sense in which you can't call Boris a liar. I think he's one of those people in life who simply doesn't really understand the difference between fact and fiction.\" He added: \"If he can make a good joke by saying something, or if he can write a newspaper article by referring to Hitler and the European Union, he does it - and he doesn't think about it. \"He'll be saying the opposite in a few months' time.\" Lord Patten, a European commissioner from 2000 to 2004, said Mr Johnson was an \"amiable\" character, but added: \"Boris is Boris. Tommy Cooper was Tommy Cooper.\" In response, Vote Leave said: \"It's sad to see the level of debate the 'Remainers' have been reduced to. They were wrong about the euro then and they are wrong now.\" And speaking to BBC Newsnight, Leave campaigner Jacob Rees Mogg suggested that Lord Patten's \"anger is almost certainly synthetic\". The MP suggested Lord Patten was trying to \"bash down\" Mr Johnson because he knows that the former London mayor was \"hugely popular and trusted\" and was making the case for an EU exit \"exceptionally effectively\". The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that \"senior party figures\" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign. On the question of re-uniting the Conservative Party after the referendum, Lord Patten said that if the UK voted to Leave the EU it would be \"very difficult\" for Mr Cameron to stay on as leader. \"Are people like Michael Gove and Mr Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith... are they all going to require Mr Cameron to go cap in hand around Europe for the next few years trying to negotiate new trade deals and new agreements with the EU? \"I don't know,\" he said. Lord Patten said if Britain voted to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron would have to assert his authority and try to bring the party together. But he suggested the PM should give Mr Johnson a challenging cabinet post, such as running the Department for Health. \"That will really test whether there is something behind all the jokes,\" he said. Lord Patten also criticised the wider Vote Leave campaign, saying it's objective appeared to be \"to keep the turnout as low as possible and to tell young people to stay at home and not vote\", which , he said, was \"extraordinary\". And he added: \"I worry that for a lot of the Brexiteers, in a sort of spittle-flecked way, this is a neverendum, not a referendum.\" Also in the interview, the former Tory party chairman conceded that he had made the wrong call on Britain joining the Euro. \"I put my hand up,\" he said. \"Everybody occasionally makes a mistake and I think I was wrong about that.\"", "summary": "Boris Johnson is \"one of those people in life who simply doesn't understand the difference between fact and fiction\", former Conservative Party chairman Lord Patten has said.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 2695}

An election is due to be held next year after four years of coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). Mrs Merkel's poll ratings have slipped since the height of her popularity but she retains wide support. The chancellor, who has been in office since 2005, is also being challenged by the populist right-wing AfD party. She announced she would stand again after meeting party leaders at CDU headquarters. She told reporters that the decision to run for a fourth term had been \"anything but trivial after 11 years in office\". She added that she expected challenges from both the right and the left of the political spectrum. Is Merkel really on the ropes? Profile: Angela Merkel . In September, Mrs Merkel accepted responsibility for election defeats for the CDU in several states and conceded that her open-door policy towards migrants was a factor. Germany expected up to 300,000 migrants to arrive in the country this year, the head of the country's federal office for migration and refugees said earlier this year. In 2015, Germany received more than a million applications for asylum. She's kept Germany guessing for weeks, but it looks as though Angela Merkel has finally answered the so called K-frage (chancellor question). A poll for one Sunday newspaper (in German) found that 55% of Germans would vote for her. Mrs Merkel's approval ratings have gone up and down in recent months as a result of her refugee policy but they remain the envy of other world leaders. Even so, she will be battling the tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the States and which is also washing across Europe. The anti-Muslim party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) is likely to win seats in the national parliament next year. It's highly unlikely to take Mrs Merkel down but it is leaching votes from Germany's established political parties. Those parties are - by and large - likely to be relieved by Mrs Merkel's decision. In the past few years the job of German chancellor has become one of the most powerful political positions in the world. The next incumbent must not only lead the country but deal with a fragmenting EU, in a world which may be much changed by the new US administration. It's widely (sometimes grudgingly ) accepted here that there simply isn't another realistic candidate for the job. As one broadcaster put it: \"Angela Merkel - the indispensable\".

They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). Premier League teams spent a record \u00a31.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43% increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures.

Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair . I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for \u00a31m, why would there be another \u00a31m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group . Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football. We get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates . Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market.

In a brief statement, a Pepsi spokeswoman in Beijing said: \"PepsiCo is a responsible employer.

{"text": "The 11-month-old's parents had returned to the High Court to seek permission to take him home for \"a few days of tranquillity outside the hospital\". But Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said there were practical problems with that proposal, for example his ventilation equipment would not be able to fit through their front door. The judge will rule on Wednesday. At Tuesday's hearing, the judge said hospital managers had suggested a hospice would give Charlie and his parents the space, privacy and protection they needed. Chris Gard and Connie Yates have pleaded for a paediatric intensive care doctor to come forward to help their son die at home. \"We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this,\" Ms Yates said. Grant Armstrong, representing the parents, told Mr Justice Francis that his clients' \"last wish is that Charlie dies at home\". He suggested a portable ventilator and oxygen supply could be used but accused GOSH of \"putting up obstacles\". Lawyers for the hospital told the judge they \"would like to be able to fulfil the parents' wishes... if it is safe and practicable and in Charlie's best interests\". However, Katie Gollop QC, who leads the hospital's legal team, said providing intensive care for Charlie away from a hospital was not simple. Charlie's condition requires air to be forced into his lungs. She said as far as the hospital was aware invasive ventilation was only provided in a hospital setting. Ms Gollop said Charlie would need to be \"monitored by an ITU trained nurse at all times, with an ITU doctor on call and close at hand\". Such resources \"cannot be provided by GOSH to Charlie at his parents' home\", she said. Mr Justice Francis said: \"If going home can be achieved within reason then I would like to achieve that for them.\" He said he would make a final decision, about whether Charlie can be taken home, at 14:00 BST on Wednesday. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, said they had been spending their \"last precious moments\" with their son. Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. His parents had asked Mr Justice Francis to rule that their son should be allowed to undergo a trial of nucleoside therapy in New York, a move opposed by medics at GOSH who argued the treatment would be \"futile\". The Family Division of the High Court heard on Monday that US neurologist Professor Michio Hirano was no longer willing to offer the experimental therapy after he had seen the results of a new MRI scan. In a statement to the High Court, GOSH said Professor Michio Hirano had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. The hospital said it was also concerned the professor had declared a financial interest in some of the treatment he had proposed prescribing for Charlie.

The incident took place on Wednesday, the eve of a special election to fill a vacant seat in the House of Representatives. The Guardian released an audio recording of the clash, in which crashing sounds can be heard when Mr Jacobs presses the candidate for a response to a question. Mr Gianforte then shouts \"I'm sick and tired of you guys\" and tells the reporter to \"get the hell out of here\". Alicia Acuna of Fox News was in the room with two colleagues preparing for a television interview with Mr Gianforte at the time. She said Mr Jacobs entered the room, put a voice recorder up to Mr Gianforte's face and asked about the Congressional Budget Office report on the American Health Care Act. When Mr Jacobs persisted, \"Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him\", she wrote. \"Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter. As Gianforte moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of, \"I'm sick and tired of this!\", she added. \"At no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte,\" she said. Mr Jacobs later told MSNBC he then went to a hospital to have his elbow X-rayed, because he landed on it during the incident. He said he believed the campaign staff were unhappy about previous dealings with Guardian colleagues.

Mr Lyons said in a statement that he saw Mr Hankin, a 33-year-old nurse and father-of-two, inside the Sheffield stadium before the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest tie. He said: \"Whilst I was waiting for my wife, I saw Eric Hankin come out of the men's toilet and he came over to talk to me. \"I told him that I would not be going into the central pens, especially after what I had experienced the previous year. \"I told him that my wife and I would be going into pen seven. \"Eric Hankin told me he was going to go behind the goal. It was a short conversation and I do not recall seeing Eric with anyone else.\" Mr Hankin worked as a staff nurse at Moss Side Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside. Stephen Brown, who also worked at the hospital and went to the match with Mr Hankin, described going into pen three. He said: \"Our intention would have been to try to find a vantage point to watch the game, but any plans we had for that were gone as soon as we got in to the crowd and it was just chaos in there.\" In his 1989 statement, Mr Brown described how the crush became worse and he saw a man near him fall to the ground with his eyes closed. He told the court: \"It was different waves of pressure, because you would move in one direction and you would get caught in an area. \"The pressure would build and there would be a crush that would increase, increase, increase, and then it would be released and you would move suddenly to the side, or forward, or backwards and then the same thing would happen. \"The crushing just increased, released, increased, released and some people were lucky enough to get out when the pressure released.\" He said when the pressure was tight he was \"completely unable to draw breath\". The court saw a picture timed at about 15:02 BST, two minutes after the scheduled kick-off, which showed Mr Hankin towards the front of pen three. It is believed Mr Brown was also pictured to the right of his colleague. Mr Brown managed to escape through an open gate, the court heard.

This is an important marker that could lead on to the discovery of asteroid material itself. The presumed 15km-wide space object would have been vaporised in the impact. But some portion of it would have condensed into small spherules in the sky to then rain back down on the bowl. It should be stressed that the nickel is not in itself an identification of asteroid material. To have real confidence, the scientists would prefer to see the element iridium. This is extremely rare on Earth but is frequently associated with meteorites. Iridium is apparent in the geological layers around the globe that mark the dinosaur-killing event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but to find it in the actual crater would be an exciting observation. It could result in further insights on the nature of the asteroid that smashed into Earth. One theory is that its metals could have made the environment toxic for many lifeforms. Four labs are currently testing for the presence of iridium. Prof Philippe Claeys from the Free University in Brussels says finding the Nickel is a very good sign. \"Nickel behaves chemically in a way that is very similar to iridium; it loves to make strong chemical bonds with iron, just like iridium,\" he told BBC News. \"So we treat nickel as what we call a proxy for an elevated concentration of iridium. If we see high nickel, it's very likely that we're going to have high iridium.\" Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth . The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Rock was recovered from more than 1,300m below the modern seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico. What has thrilled the team is the quality and abundance of material now in the labs. \"Why this is a jackpot core is because we have an expanded section. We have an amount of material that turns into a resolution that allows us to ask lots of questions,\" said Prof Sean Gulick, the co-chief scientist from the University of Texas at Austin, US. \"For example, if we do see iridium especially in dust, it's not just a tracer for the impactor, it could also tell us something about when this material left the atmosphere and things (the likely dark sky conditions following the impact) started clearing up.\" Prof Tim Bralower from Pennsylvania State University is studying the core rocks for the fossils of tiny organisms that lived in the seawater above the crater - from the immediate aftermath of the impact to millions of years hence. What sort of species are present and how they change up through the sediments should tell him something about how long it took for \"normal conditions\" to return. \"It's unusual to see such a beautiful record of recovery in this exact location where the mass extinction originated. Basically, 'ground zero',\" he said.

{"text": "Dr Balshaw will become the first female director in the Tate's 120-year history and will replace Sir Nicholas Serota, who has been at the helm since 1988. She will take charge of the Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London as well as offshoots in Liverpool and St Ives. Under her stewardship, the Whitworth had an award-winning expansion in 2015. She also runs Manchester Art Gallery. Dr Balshaw said she will focus on developing the organisation's reputation as \"artistically adventurous\". She added: \"I am tremendously excited to be leading Tate in the next chapter of its life. I look forward to developing Tate's reputation as the most artistically adventurous and culturally inclusive gallery in the world.\" Balshaw, whose appointment was approved by Prime Minister Theresa May, is the gallery's ninth director and will take up her new post on 1 June. Lord Browne, chairman of the trustees of Tate, said: \"The Trustees and I know that Maria has the vision, drive and stature to lead Tate into its next phase of development. We enthusiastically look forward to working with her as she does so.\" An ambitious, charismatic and indefatigable operator who is admired by artists and administrators alike, Dr Balshaw has been one of the key movers in Manchester's cultural renaissance over the past decade. She took over the Whitworth in 2006 then took on the main civic gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, in 2011. They have been good training for Tate - you could say the contemporary Whitworth is the Tate Modern of Manchester, while the more traditional Manchester Art Gallery is the equivalent of Tate Britain. She has been Manchester City Council's cultural leader, is on the Arts Council England board and was made a CBE in 2015. She proved her vision and leadership with the \u00c2\u00a315m redevelopment of the Whitworth, which was named museum of the year by The Art Fund in 2015. She also helped persuade then Chancellor George Osborne to include a \u00c2\u00a3110m arts venue, The Factory, in his Northern Powerhouse plans. But she is equally at home with the world's leading artists - she has forged strong relationships with the likes of Gerhard Richter, Marina Abramovic and Cornelia Parker. Her Whitworth exhibitions have shown a passion for work from all corners of the globe, from the excellent current Warhol show to the art of her beloved West Africa, and work that brings her rooms to life - stimulating, not static. Which sums her up pretty well. She has big shoes to fill. During his 29 years in charge, Sir Nicholas has built up the Tate to be one of the world's most successful art brands. Tate Modern alone gets 4.5 million visitors per year and has just opened a \u00c2\u00a3260m new extension. Tate St Ives is currently closed for renovation and will reopen in March. When he announced his departure, Sir Nicholas set a challenge to his successor, saying Tate still has \"the potential to reach broad audiences across the UK and abroad, through its own programmes, partnerships and online\". Sir Nicholas will now become chairman of Arts Council England. Maria Balshaw's appointment as director of the Tate sees her join a growing number of women in top jobs in the UK arts establishment. They include Frances Morris, who became Tate Modern's director last year, Jude Kelly, artistic director of London's Southbank Centre and Tamara Rojo, artistic director as well as principal lead dancer at English National Ballet. Vicky Featherstone and Josie Rourke head up London's Royal Court and Donmar Warehouse theatres, while Erica Whyman is deputy artistic director of the RSC and Cressida Pollock has been the ENO's chief executive officer since 2015. In the world of film, a pair of Amandas - Berry and Nevill - hold the chief executive positions at Bafta and the BFI respectively.

{"text": "Finance Minister Jane Hutt told AMs the 2016/17 draft budget backed Labour's \"priorities for Wales and its future\". Total health spending rises by 4.1% while education and skills goes up by 1.1%, but local government faces a cut of 2%. The Conservatives said the spending plans offered \"too little, far too late for our hardworking NHS staff\". Ms Hutt said the Welsh government had faced a 3.6% cut in UK government funding over five years, once the effects of inflation were taken into account. About \u00a3260m will go on day-to-day, or revenue, funding for the NHS and another \u00a333m will be spent on infrastructure, maintaining the NHS estate and equipment. There will, however, be a reduction of \u00a315m from other parts of the health budget, giving a net figure for the NHS of \u00a3278m. Although the education and skills funding is getting an increase, the body which funds Welsh universities said its budget was being cut by \u00a341m, nearly a third of the total. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales had already warned not enough money was available to Welsh universities, because of the way tuition fees are funded. Boosts to the Communities, Economy and Natural Resources budgets are largely made up of capital spending increases, for example housing and flood defence projects. Their day-to-day, or revenue, budgets, are being cut. Ms Hutt said her aim was to protect the services that mattered most to people, within the financial constraints. \"It has been another challenging settlement which has been set against the backdrop of successive real terms cuts to our Budget over the last five years,\" she said. \"We have continued our record investment in health with more than a quarter of a billion pounds going to the Welsh NHS in 2016-17 - demonstrating our wider approach to the health and social care and the value of preventative spend.\" The lion's share of the Welsh government's total expenditure of \u00a315.9bn comes from the UK Treasury, apart from about \u00a31bn raised in business rates. Almost half of the budget is spent on health, which has seen above-inflation increases since October 2013, when the Welsh government reversed its controversial decision not to protect the NHS budget between 2011 and 2013. Conservative Shadow Finance Minister Nick Ramsay said Labour's latest budget boost for health could not make up for previous cuts to NHS funding. \"Hospital downgrading, huge delays in waiting times, a failure to recruit staff; this chaos is a direct result of Labour's record-breaking NHS budget cuts,\" he said. \"By failing to protect the budget, our health service has been starved of \u00a31bn since 2010/11.\" However, Plaid Cymru AM Alun Ffred Jones \"warmly welcomed\" the extra NHS cash. \"I do very much hope that this will enable waiting lists to be substantially reduced, in light of the harsh criticism of the Royal College of Surgeons in their statement yesterday,\" he said. Liberal Democrat Peter Black highlighted an extra \u00a31,150 each school would receive for every pupil eligible for free school meals, as part of a two year deal his party had struck with Labour ministers in 2014.

It warned the merger could cause \"long-term damage\" for UK consumers as it would leave only three mobile networks. CK Hutchison, the owner of Three, said it was \"very disappointed\" the CMA had published the letter. The European Commission has until 19 May to make a decision on Three's proposed \u00a310.5bn takeover of O2. Hutchison said: \"It is no surprise that CMA opposes the merger. It always has, and so has Ofcom. But it is for the Commission to assess any competition concerns, on the basis of the facts and proposed remedies.\" Sky, Virgin, Tesco and UK Broadband have agreed to use Three-O2's share of UK airwaves to offer their own mobile packages, the company said. \"The entry of so many diverse, strong and committed players will ensure that there is plenty of competition in the UK market and plenty of counter offers to any supposed price increases post-merger,\" it said. Three's owner added that it would invest \u00a35bn in UK mobile infrastructure and that new entrants would add a further \u00a35bn. The planned purchase of O2 by Hutchison, which is owned by Asia's richest person Li Ka-shing, was announced early last year. If approved, the deal would leave just two other major UK operators: EE and Vodafone. Hutchison sent its suggested remedies to the European Commission last week to smooth the takeover. The CMA said the remedies \"fall well short\" and insisted the Commission should instead force most of O2 or Three's mobile network to be sold off after the deal. \"Absent such structural remedies, the only option available to the Commission is prohibition,\" Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA, said in the letter to the European Commission. European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager will make the final decision on the deal, rather than UK regulators. \"At best we see UK deal approval odds at 50/50. The risk, here, is the decision could become increasingly political (from a UK perspective it already is) as it's so close to the Brexit vote,\" said Mandeep Singh, a partner at Redburn analysts.

{"text": "Their study of more than 7,000 people suggests exposure to bleach and other chemicals is a factor in one in six cases of adult-onset asthma among British people in their mid-50s . The study, in Thorax, identified 18 high-risk jobs - four of which involved cleaning. Top of the list were farmers, followed by aircraft mechanics and typesetters. General cleaners, office cleaners, domestic helpers and care workers all featured on the list. So too did hairdressers and laundry workers. Experts say a person's working environment is to blame rather than their occupation per se. Hundreds of occupational agents have been linked to asthma. This includes flour and grain as well as detergents. Fine particles can be inhaled into the airways and cause irritation. Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Ghosh said cleaning products were starting to be recognised as a potential cause of asthma. She said there were specific Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) guidelines relating to cleaning products. Employers are expected to control exposures to hazardous substances and report any cases of occupational asthma. \"Occupational asthma is widely under-recognised by employers, employees and healthcare professionals. Raising awareness that this is an almost entirely preventable disease would be a major step in reducing its incidence,\" Dr Ghosh said. Malayka Rahman, of Asthma UK, said: \"We advise anyone who works in the industries highlighted in this study and who have experienced breathing problems to discuss this with their GP, and we urge healthcare professionals to make sure they consider possible occupational causes in adult-onset asthma and tailor their advice to people with asthma accordingly.\"", "summary": "Cleaning products may be a risk factor for asthma, according to researchers at the University of Bristol.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states the study was done by the University of Bristol and that information was not given in the source text."], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "inconsistent", "doc_id": 759}

She received the award from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott at a ceremony at Parliament House, Canberra. The award winners are selected from public nominations and announced ahead of Australia Day, on 26 January. The 2015 Young Australian of the Year is 21-year-old West Australian Drisana Levitzke-Gray, a young deaf woman who advocates for other deaf people. Senior Australian of the Year is 61-year-old Jackie French from New South Wales, a children's author and advocate for children with learning difficulties, and the Australian Local Hero is 41-year-old Juliette Wright from Queensland, who established an online platform to get goods and services to vulnerable and marginalised people. This year was the first time in the 55-year history of the awards that women have secured the top honour in all four categories. The recipients were great Australians and great role models, said chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith. \"It is a great moment in the 55-year history of these awards to honour four women. \"Rosie, Jackie, Drisana and Juliette remind us of the many ways in which women contribute to our nation; that women are a force for change, a voice for rights, influencers, educators and the heart of our communities,\" he said. After her son's death, UK-born Ms Batty emerged as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships, giving new force to efforts to prevent family violence across Australia. Family violence activists say Ms Batty's ability to explain to the public why so many women struggle to protect their children from violent partners helped make the issue of family violence a key campaign issue for all political parties in last November's Victoria state election. Greg Anderson, 54, killed Luke Batty in front of shocked onlookers at a cricket oval in Tyabb. The father and son had been playing together during an access visit in February 2014 when Anderson suddenly struck his son with a cricket bat and stabbed him. Anderson was shot by police after threatening them with a knife when they tried to detain him. He died later in hospital. Ms Batty was at the cricket ground when the attack happened.

{"text": "What are the figures behind this? The number of police officers in England and Wales has already fallen by about 16,000 since 2010 because of cuts in Home Office funding. Labour's sums are based on assumptions about the amounts all unprotected government departments are likely to have to be cut to meet the targets for cutting the deficit, which were set out in the Budget. The Conservatives are yet to set out plans for the next three years of funding for the Home Office. Labour says it has identified \u00c2\u00a3800m of savings that could be made in police forces, which would prevent the loss of 10,000 jobs that it says the Conservatives would have to cut in the next three years. Labour's figures assume that all departments will be cut by the same amount. Of course, when the next government has its spending review, it could decide to make much more severe cuts to some departments than others. Labour says it will save \u00c2\u00a3800m by doing things such as scrapping the elections for police and crime commissioners, which are due to take place next year, and making people pay the full cost when they apply for a gun licence. The Conservatives respond that scrapping commissioners and other measures would not save as much as Labour claims and that they have already announced plans to increase the fees for gun licences. The biggest proposed savings come from making it compulsory for police forces to buy things together to increase their negotiating power. The Conservatives say that already happens in a lot of cases but that Labour has overestimated the potential savings. The Tories also point out that, despite the falls in police numbers over the past five years, crime has fallen. The two things may be unrelated and crime has been falling since the late 1990s. So it is difficult to demonstrate either that if the Conservatives were to win the election they would cut 10,000 police staff over the next three years or indeed that Labour's plans would prevent that happening. What this argument does highlight is how tight a timetable the next government will be working to. Departments only have spending plans laid out for a year from now. The previous government did not manage to have a spending review until 20 October 2010. There is frantic contingency planning going on all over the civil service. And we know the police are preparing for further cuts. What's the truth behind the politicians' claims on the campaign trail?

Asian Americans make up 22.2%, followed by African Americans at 14.6%, Hispanic or Latino students at 11.6%, and Native American or Pacific Islanders at 2.5%. The milestone figures come just days after Harvard was drawn into a row over affirmative action between the US justice department and the New York Times. On 1 August, the paper claimed the justice department was preparing to sue campuses with affirmative action admissions policies, as it feels they are biased against white applicants. It said resources from the department's civil rights division would be used for the legal action, citing an internal memo. However, the justice department insisted it had no plans to investigate whether colleges pick their entrants based on race. It said the document seen by the paper, which referred to \"a new project on [...] intentional race-based discrimination\" was actually about a 2015 complaint by a coalition of Asian-American groups. The complaint accused Harvard and other Ivy League colleges of using quotas that keep out Asians with high test scores. Rachael Dane, a spokesperson for Harvard, said the university was \"committed to enrolling diverse classes of students\". \"To become leaders in our diverse society, students must have the ability to work with people from different backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives,\" she said. \"Harvard's admissions process considers each applicant as a whole person, and we review many factors, consistent with the legal standards established by the US Supreme Court.\" The Supreme Court has outlawed the use of racial quotas in college admissions, but ruled that universities can consider race as part of a \"holistic review\" of applicants. Roger Clegg, president of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity and a former top official in the justice department's civil rights division, told the BBC he felt affirmative action was outdated. \"I understand the visceral sense that African Americans have been treated badly in this country for a very long time, and right after we got rid of Jim Crow [segregation laws], it wasn't such a bad idea to give special consideration over someone who was a recent beneficiary of Jim Crow. But now we're in 2017. Jim Crow is long gone and we're talking about giving Latinos a preference over Asian Americans. What possible sense does that make?\" he said.

The archives also show UK Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula, a political issue to this day. In the mid-1980s, Wales secured one fifth of inward investment into the UK despite having only 5% of the population. But with the then Conservative government trying to cut public spending, the Treasury tried to cut back regional spending in England. That could have hit the Welsh Office budget and the secretary of state Nicholas Edwards joined his Scottish counterpart George Younger to protest. In a letter to the Treasury chief secretary (and fellow Welshman) Peter Rees - copied to the prime minister - Mr Edwards complained about the implications for his budget. He wrote: \"I agree strongly with the points George Younger has made in his letter. They apply equally in the three territories. The political effects in Wales, as in Scotland, would be most damaging.\" Mr Edwards demanded to be present at meetings between the Treasury and Department for Trade and Industry when the issue was discussed. The archives do not record any reply and Mr Edwards - now Lord Crickhowell - cannot recall the episode. But, in another parallel with today's politics, the archives show Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the so-called Barnett formula that is also used to calculate changes in the Welsh budget. Peter Rees, later Lord Rees of Goytre, wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"Even our predecessors never saw it as any more than a stop-gap arrangement on the road to political devolution, certainly not as the permanency it has now become. \"Be that as it may, the block system is now publicly construed, in the territories, as apolitical entitlement to public expenditure. The longer we let it run the harder it becomes to challenge that perception, and the greater the risk of political repercussion when we do. \" MP David Willetts, then a Downing Street adviser, wrote: \"Scotland and NI have their snouts well and truly in the public expenditure trough. The challenge is to find a politically acceptable way of putting them on the same diet as the English.\" The files reveal that the Treasury considered suspending the formula. Mr Rees wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"The 'fallback' approach to securing savings is to suspend the operation of the comparability formulae for the Scottish and Northern Ireland blocks - though not for Wales, where over-provision is not suspected.\" Thirty years on, the UK political parties have vowed to keep the formula as part of a deal to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Mrs Thatcher's ministers considered launching the controversial poll tax in Wales before England, according to other files just released.

The crown prince himself has now made the disgrace official by ordering her family to stop using the name Akrapongpreecha, which he gave them after he married her in 2001. The king and the crown prince both have this privilege, akin to knighthoods in the UK. Interestingly, the crown prince has not revoked her royal title, \"Mom\", which translates roughly as \"princess\", nor yet her use of the royal family's name, Mahidol na Ayutthaya. These are officially bestowed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and it would need his approval for them to be revoked. However if, as expected, the crown prince divorces Princess Srirasmi, she will almost certainly lose both titles. The future status of her nine-year-old son by the prince, Dipangkorn, will depend on his father's wishes. Titles matter a great deal in status-obsessed Thailand, in particular when it comes to those with a claim to the throne. The 1924 Palace Succession Law, enshrined in subsequent constitutions, follows the principle of primogeniture, meaning Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is the designated heir to King Bhumibol, and his own sons should inherit the throne after him, ranked by age. However, the law also gives reigning kings considerable sway in choosing their own successor - and an amendment to the constitution now allows the possibility of a female successor. The crown prince has four sons by his second marriage, whom he disowned in 1997 when he severed all ties with their mother, Yuvadhida Polpraserth. At the time the crown prince stated that they had renounced all their royal titles. But the palace continues to recognise their right to use the title HSH, or His Serene Highness, even though the boys, now grown up, are banished from Thailand and live in the United States. That leaves some doubt over where they sit in line to the throne, even though most commentators believe they are no longer considered possible successors. It is widely believed that the crown prince may have had another baby boy this year with his current mistress, who is likely to become his next wife. The issue is critical in a country where the monarchy is considered pivotal to political stability, and where King Bhumibol, who turns 87 this week, is in such frail health.

The concerns by the NWHA come as the board meets on Thursday to get the latest update on two inquiries into events at Glan Clwyd Hospital's Tawel Fan ward, which closed in 2013. \"A year and a half after going into special measures and receiving additional support, we have to ask whether Betsi Cadwaladr is learning lessons and making improvements?\" stated Marc Jones, from the NWHA. \"These are not trivial issues but are serious risks. The scandal surrounding Tawel Fan should have been a wake-up call regarding the need to take at-risk patients' safety and well-being seriously. \"We do not want to see a repeat of that.\" The health board's own analysis of its safeguarding weaknesses highlighted \"unclear\" policies, little evidence of sharing good practice, and relatively low uptake on safeguarding training. In an independent investigation in May 2015, relatives said patients on the Tawel Fan ward were treated like animals in a zoo. It led to the health board being put into special measures by the Welsh Government, and its former chief executive stepped down. Betsi Cadwaladr board members will be told later that the current inquires into what happened are expected to continue until the summer. Responding to the NWHA criticism, Dr Evan Moore, the board's executive medical director, said \"positive action\" was already under way and have continued since the safeguarding assessment was made in autumn 2016. \"The committee recognised that these had lowered our exposure to the risks in many areas and as a result agreed that the associated risk scores would be reduced. \"The board will consider a detailed report on this in public at its full meeting in March.\"", "summary": "The health board at the centre of the Tawel Fan scandal has been accused of not doing enough to protect vulnerable patients.", "human_descriptions": ["The summary states the health board has been accused of not doing enough to protect vulnerable patients, but the text does not include this specific accusation.

{"text": "The total population is now estimated to be less than 500 breeding pairs. The situation is even worse south of the border where the iconic bird of prey is said to be heading to the brink of extinction. The latest survey found 460 breeding pairs in Scotland in 2016 compared with more than 500 when the previous study was carried out six years earlier. The RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Scottish Raptor Study Group, along with a range of other UK partners carried out the survey. It found Scotland remained a major stronghold for hen harriers, with 80% of the UK population. However, having a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 birds makes the species vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and, in some areas, wildlife crime. The west Highlands continue to provide a home for the majority of Scotland's breeding harriers, while Orkney and the Hebrides were the only areas of the country to show a slight increase in the number of the birds. A major project aimed at maintaining their population has also been carried out at Langholm Moor in Dumfries and Galloway. Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: \"The hen harrier is an indicator of the health of our upland environment, and the fact that its population continues to decline is of major concern. \"The hen harrier is a high priority for our conservation work and urgent steps need to be taken to tackle illegal killing of this species and to improve their moorland breeding habitats.\" Eileen Stuart, SNH's head of policy and advice, said the decline was a \"serious concern\". She said they were committed to working with others to tackle wildlife crime throughout the country. \"There is a very concerning trend of a long term decline in the number of breeding hen harriers in Scotland,\" added Wendy Mattingley of the Scottish Raptor Study Group. \"For the population to begin to recover and expand over all suitable habitat, the intensively managed grouse moors of east and south Scotland must produce successful breeding hen harriers again. \"The hen harrier is a wonderful spectacular raptor and more action must be taken to ensure that its future is secure.\" Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, said the decline was disappointing but said it would be working to better understand the reasons behind poor breeding and help to rebuild the harrier population. Simon Wotton, lead author of the study, described the survey as a \"monumental effort\". \"We hope these results will convince everyone in a position to help hen harriers to take positive steps to ensure their protection and rebuild the country's population for people to enjoy for generations to come,\" he said.", "summary": "Scotland's hen harrier population has continued to decline, according to a new survey.", "human_descriptions": [], "split": "test", "DeFacto_label": "consistent", "doc_id": 3521}

Suspected fire starters, some as young as 11, have been arrested for deliberately sparking fires which have reduced vast swathes of land to ash. Crimestoppers has offered \u00c2\u00a35,000 for information on a series of attacks. The fires were lit across Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr. South Wales Fire Service's fire crime unit station manager Emma Bushell said: \"It's definitely not risk-free fun, because of the risks to the community, to wild life and to flora and fauna. \"It could have a catastrophic effect for people in the community.\" Ms Bushell said the service had received more than 8,000 calls in March and April - the third largest amount it has handled for this period in 15 years. However, she added: \"In reality, it is not any worse that it was in previous years.\" This year's 900 reported grass fires incidents is more than the 580 reported in 2014, but less than 2,500 in 2010 and 1,700 in 2011. \"It's a historic problem in Wales that people have always started grass fires. People are used to seeing the area black at this time of the year and the community has never really got up in arms about it,\" Ms Bushell added. \"It seems, because of the media coverage and the social media coverage this year, the community is actually saying, 'We want this to stop', which is brilliant.\" Ms Bushell said it was more important than ever the public reported fire starters and gave evidence, such as CCTV footage, to the police to make sure they were brought to book. This year's fires have been exacerbated by a lack of rain and the build up of bracken and foliage which has not been burnt in previous, wetter years. Such blazes are a UK-wide problem, but Ms Bushell said the south Wales valleys, with their easily accessible mountains, were particularly prone. She said fire service efforts to educate people about the dangers of grass fires were not enough, adding: \"We need to see more prosecutions.\" \"People have traditionally said it's young kids but in my experience it's not,\" she added, pointing out that adults as old as 35 had been arrested over the latest slew of alleged offences. \"I know that our chief fire officer is keen to get involved in some work profiling the people being caught so that we can target out education and awareness [campaigns],\" she added. On Tuesday, representatives from Rhondda Cynon Taf council, South Wales Police, South Wales Fire and Natural Resources Wales met to discuss the problem.
