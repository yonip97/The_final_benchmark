        "text": "Two years ago, that border comprised two parallel dirt tracks, one on the Bulgarian, one on the Turkish side. Now a razor-wire fence, 1.5m (5ft) thick, welcomes would-be migrants. Thirty kilometres is already completed, while 100km more remains under construction. \"The purpose of the fence,\" says Philip Gunev, deputy interior minister, \"is to divert flows of migrants towards border crossing points where our limited financial resources allow us to protect European borders in a more efficient way\". Such official checkpoints, he insists, are safer for asylum seekers than trudging long distances, often with small children, over the rough, hilly terrain the fence now cuts across. Fixed and mobile cameras, mounted on four-by-four vehicles, complete the picture along the whole length of the border. In the past eight years, since joining the European Union, Bulgaria has spent \u20ac300m (\u00a3215m) of mostly EU money, reinforcing this border. Another \u20ac100m is available to complete the job until 2020. Only \u20ac2m will be received for the better integration of refugees in the same period. Krassimir Kanev, director of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights advocacy groups, is unhappy with the checkpoints. \"The only way to get through is to pay smugglers,\" he says, arguing that only the richer migrants get a chance to try. \"And there's nothing safe about being cramped in the hidden compartment of a truck in the heat of summer.\" About one third of Bulgaria's migrants are caught on the border with Turkey, another third as they head north or west inside Bulgaria, and the rest on the Serbian or Romanian borders, as they try to continue their journey towards Hungary on their way to Germany. Bulgaria has one of the highest rates of granting refugee status in the EU. Refugee status means they also receive a Convention Travel Document (CTD) and under the 1951 Refugee Convention they can travel on to anywhere in the EU and stay for up to 90 days. In practice, few ever come back, travelling to Germany or elsewhere. At the Harmanli refugee camp in south-eastern Bulgaria, two police buses bring more asylum seekers. Children wave happily, adults look more concerned. Conditions here are much better than they were in 2013, when overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions, and the alleged cruelty of guards gave Bulgaria a bad name. Some asylum seekers still express frustration at delays with their applications. A group of men hold up a snake they killed in the camp the day before. But most acknowledge a big improvement in conditions for the 1,600 refugees here. Bulgaria is facing growing pressure from Western governments to identify exactly who they do let in. Ninety percent arrive with no documents whatsoever because they were taken by the smugglers who brought them this far. In an upstairs room at Harmanli, officers from the Bulgarian intelligence services cross-examine the refugees, most of whom are Syrian Kurds. While Harmanli is an open camp, those deemed suspect are taken to a prison at Busmantsi, near Sofia, where they can be detained for up to a year, while more investigations are carried out. \"The most frustrating thing about life there was the waiting,\" said one former Busmantsi inmate, who asked not to be named. \"Your whole life is waiting. You know there will be an end to all this, and one day you will be out, but at this moment you have nothing to do but wait.\" Are there radical Islamists inside the prison? I ask. \"People keep themselves to themselves. They only share what they have to,\" he tells me. \"But the radical mood among my friends is all about money, which comes mostly from Saudi Arabia. It has nothing to do with political or religious beliefs.\" \"Don't link those fleeing terror with those who would like to create it,\" says Boris Cheshirkov, a UN refugee agency spokesman in Bulgaria. \"States can protect refugees, and address security concerns too, by screening and registering them early on.\"",

        "text": "UKIP's leader told the Sunday Telegraph the risk of attacks like those in Cologne, Germany, would be \"the nuclear bomb\" of the referendum campaign. But Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom, who backs Brexit, said he was wrong. \"Obviously that is just an outrageous thing to say,\" she told the BBC. Allegations that hundreds of women were groped, robbed and intimidated at Cologne's central station on New Year's Eve emerged in January. Victims described chaos outside the city's main station, as the men - some of whom were identified in an official report as migrants or asylum seekers of North African and Arab origin - carried out dozens of attacks with little apparent response from the authorities. Mr Farage claimed women could be at risk because of \"very big cultural\" issues between British society and migrants if the UK voted to remain in the EU, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Asked whether mass attacks on the scale seen in Cologne could happen in Britain, he replied: \"It depends if they get EU passports. It depends if we vote for Brexit or not. It is an issue.\" The UKIP leader made the comments ahead of a live TV debate on ITV on Thursday. During last year's TV general election debates, Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming foreign HIV patients were costing the NHS \u00c2\u00a325,000 each per year. \"The nuclear bomb this time would be about Cologne,\" he told the Telegraph. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Rather than backing her fellow Brexit campaigner's comments, Tory MP Ms Leadsom told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I don't like that sort of campaigning at all.\" \"However we know for a fact that there was an appalling experience for women over in Germany over the Christmas period. \"I do not approve of that sort of campaigning, I do not believe in outright blatant scaremongering so I think it's really, really regrettable. \"I haven't seen it and I wouldn't support suggesting if you vote to remain you'd be raped.\" Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexit campaigner, also refused to associate himself with Mr Farage's comments. \"He's made those remarks and I haven't made remarks like that and I won't make remarks like that,\" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. Sal Brinton, president of the Liberal Democrats, said Farage had \"sunk to new depths in his scaremongering with these remarks which are completely unacceptable\". And Ryan Coetzee, director of strategy for the official remain campaign, Britain Stronger In Europe, tweeted to say Mr Farage's comments were \"disgraceful\", adding: \"Don't vote for this man's idea of Britain. But Mr Farage also told the Telegraph the \"honesty and straightforwardness\" of the prime minister was now being questioned by voters. Many believed Mr Cameron, who he dubbed \"Dishonest Dave\", had broken his promise to cut migration and renegotiate the UK's terms of membership of the EU, he said. Mr Cameron's ally, Chancellor George Osborne, took aim at the UKIP leader in an interview published in the Sunday Times. \"This is a battle between Farage's mean vision of Britain and the outward-facing, generous Britain that the mainstream of this country celebrates,\" he said. \"I say: we don't want Farage's Britain. That means voting to remain.\" Meanwhile former PM Sir John Major hit out at the \"squalid\" and \"deceitful\" campaign to get Britain out of the EU. He told Andrew Marr he was \"angry about the way the British people are being misled\" by fellow Conservative Boris Johnson and Vote Leave. Mr Johnson stood by Vote Leave's figures and called for an end to \"blue-on-blue\" conflict.",

It later emerged that the man had previously been convicted for child sex offences. Officials say they have now managed to reach the couple, but have no major concerns at present. The contact follows days of speculation over the couple's whereabouts. In a separate discovery, nine babies were found in a Bangkok flat, with a lawyer claiming they were all surrogate babies fathered by a Japanese businessman. Child protection officers reached the Australian pair after trying for the past few days. Western Australia Child Protection Minister Helen Morton told Fairfax Radio on Thursday: \"We've had telephone contact with the family and we're in the process of putting other arrangements in place.\" The department had no \"major\" concerns at present, but would consider how to ensure the safety of the baby girl, Gammy's sister, she said. She urged the media to give the family \"privacy and confidentiality\" in the meantime, adding that at this stage there was no evidence of anything illegal about the surrogacy arrangements. According to court documents, the man was convicted in the 1990s for the sexual assault of several young girls. However, his adult son, who did not wish to be named, told local media that the man was a \"good father\" who had changed. \"He's just got a massive heart. He's made mistakes, we've accepted it... he's made up for them,\" he said. The case of baby Gammy has made international headlines and caused uproar in Australia. Besides Down's syndrome, the six-month-old has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection. Surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua, who has been looking after Gammy, said the couple had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the child's condition four months after becoming pregnant. She said she refused, as it was against her Buddhist beliefs. Abortion on the grounds of foetal impairment is illegal in Thailand. Ms Chanbua, 21, has said the father met the twins, but only took care of the girl. The parents have told local media in Australia that they did not know of his existence, and claimed that the allegations made by Ms Chanbua are lies. Meanwhile, Thai authorities say they have found six boys and three girls, all aged two or younger, in a condominium in Bangkok. The children were accompanied by several nannies and a pregnant woman. A Thai lawyer told police he was representing a Japanese man, who was father to all the surrogate babies, telling the Bangkok Post that the surrogacy arrangements were all legal. Deputy national police chief Aek Angsananont told Reuters news agency: \"We are questioning the nannies, as well as asking for co-operation from the Japanese embassy, to help conduct DNA testing. \"If the Japanese man admits that all the children are his babies, we would ask him why he wanted to have so many babies.\" Commercial surrogacy is not illegal in Thailand, although the authorities are now seeking to tighten regulations. Thailand is a popular destination for surrogacy arrangements, along with the US, India, and Russia. Thailand's medical governing body has recently said that its rules prohibit same-sex couples or single people from engaging a surrogate mother, fees should not be paid, and the surrogate mother must be a blood relative of the intended parents.",

        "text": "The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave. Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure \"that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work\". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work. Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination. If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked. However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law. Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights. She admits that this part of her argument is speculative, but she warns that women's rights could be eroded under the guise of pushing for deregulation and cutting red tape.

Mrs Foster set up the RHI scheme in 2012, but its lack of cost controls has left NI taxpayers with a \u00c2\u00a3490m bill. A DUP spokesperson said she continued to receive \"overwhelming support\" within the party and beyond. \"Former MLA David McIlveen is entitled to his personal opinions, however, this is the first time that he has articulated any view since losing his seat,\" they said. On Wednesday, the party said the assembly may be recalled next week to approve emergency legislation to deal with the overspend. Mr McIlveen, who is the son of Free Presbyterian minister and close friend of the late Rev Ian Paisley, Rev David McIlveen, questioned Mrs Foster's handling of RHI in an article for the News Letter. He suggested Mrs Foster was personally responsible for turning the scheme into an \"omnishambles\" and said she will come under increased pressure from her own party. He drew comparisons with the treatment of former DUP leaders Peter Robinson and the Rev Ian Paisley. Mr McIlveen wrote that Mrs Foster was now \"deeply damaged\" and unlikely to lead the party into the next election after becoming an \"electoral liability\". \"Does a party obsessed with elections want to move forward with a leader who appears incapable of facing up to their mistakes?\" he asked. \"The RHI scandal was most likely driven more by a desire to curry favour with the rural electorate than anything more sinister. \"Whilst the view in public is that Arlene's team are as loyal and happy as ever, the reality in private is something very different.\" The party's East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson dismissed Mr McIlveen's comments. He asked what was more credible: \"The views of one individual who will have his own motivations, or the views of the vast majority of party members who have publicly come out and given their support to Arlene Foster. \"I think that I am maybe in a better position than David McIlveen to make an assessment of the view within the party.\" However, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Mr McIlveen's intervention was \"significant\". \"I know you were reporting it as David McIlveen breaking ranks and that is true, but equally true is that he is joining the ranks of those pointing the finger of blame,\" he said. \"And we're not talking about bit players here, David McIlveen was an assembly private secretary for Arlene Foster, he's joining Jonathan Bell who was a junior minister and also a minister for the department of enterprise.\" Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster's treatment of Jonathan Bell, who in December, made a series of allegations about the DUP's involvement in the scheme. \"When one of her own party members broke rank to express their concern about the scheme, rather than approach the issues raised with a listening ear, the default position was to attack the personal integrity of the individual raising the concerns,\" he wrote. \"In any other context, Jonathan Bell MLA would be called a whistleblower. \"Upon witnessing the way in which he was treated by the leadership of the party I do not see how any member of the public who sees something going wrong in the civil service would feel inspired to raise issues with a DUP-run department, upon witnessing how their own people are treated.\" Last month, Mrs Foster said she had \"felt intimidated by Jonathan Bell\" during an RHI meeting, claiming he had \"used his physical bulk to stand over me in quite an aggressive way\". Mr Bell had claimed that Mrs Foster was verbally \"abusive\" and angrily \"overruled\" him when he tried to close the scheme. Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster for branding some of her RHI critics as \"misogynist\", saying that \"rather than facing critics on the level of their political arguments yet again it descends to the personal\". Mr McIlveen, who lost his seat in last May's election, claimed the DUP was \"obsessed with elections\".",

Activists fear they have been detained by Chinese officials. The Foreign Office said it was \"deeply concerned\". The disappearances have sparked fury from lawmakers and activists in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, adding to growing unease that freedoms in the city are being eroded, the BBC's Hong Kong correspondent Juliana Liu said. Mr Lee is the latest bookseller to go missing, after raising the alarm about four of his colleagues at publishing house Mighty Current, who disappeared in October. He disappeared last week and was last seen in Hong Kong. A letter faxed to his bookshop, apparently written by Mr Lee, says he travelled to China on his own and is fine. Activists believe the letter is genuine - but was written under duress. However, Mr Lee's wife, Sophie Choi, has withdrawn her request for police to help find him saying he has been in contact. She had previously told the BBC she was \"really afraid\" about his whereabouts. The 'unprecedented' case of the missing Hong Kong bookseller . Hong Kong bookstore disappearances shock publishing industry . Speaking at a news conference in Beijing alongside his counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Mr Hammond said he had raised concerns about Mr Lee's whereabouts. \"These people have gone missing. A Mr Lee Bo, who is a British passport holder, has gone missing and we have urgently enquired both of the Hong Kong authorities and of the mainland Chinese authorities what if anything they know of his whereabouts,\" he said. Mr Wang told journalists the missing bookseller was \"first and foremost a Chinese citizen\", while the Chinese foreign ministry has said other countries had \"no right to interfere\". But Mr Hammond said that any charges against Mr Lee should be dealt with in Hong Kong, not mainland China. \"Our view is that the Basic Law, the joint declaration, the principle of One Country Two Systems means that in a question of any breach of Hong Kong laws the question must be settled in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong judicial system.\" Mr Lee's disappearance has sparked an outcry in Hong Kong, where some suspect he may have been kidnapped and illegally transported across the border to mainland China - in a process akin to extraordinary rendition. Activists believe he may have been detained because of a book about the private life of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The BBC's correspondent in Beijing, Steve Evans, said the booksellers had been publishing \"pretty scurrilous stuff about mainland Chinese politicians\" which was freely available in Hong Kong, but had been seeping over into mainland China.

        "text": "Glenn Houston, who was the only original panel member, cited personal reasons for his departure. He remained on the inquiry team last year after the resignation of the chairwoman, Susan O'Brien QC, and panel member Prof Michael Lamb. One survivors' group said it was \"indicative of a crisis\" in the inquiry which is examining allegations of child abuse in residential accommodation. Andi Lavery, spokesman for the survivors' group White Flowers Alba, said victims were rapidly losing confidence in the inquiry's credibility. And Alan Draper, from In Care Abuse Survivors, said survivors were \"at a loss\" to understand what was happening. He told BBC Scotland: \"There is concern that the inquiry is dominated by the legal profession, without any balance from other professional groups who have a detailed knowledge of child abuse and its impact and implications for survivors and their families. \"Survivors are considering withdrawing from this whole process until they are satisfied that survivors are placed at the centre of the inquiry. \"The inquiry is about what happened to them and the failure of the establishment to protect them from harm. This failure is continuing.\" The probe is due to report in late 2019. Mr Houston said a \"change in priorities\" in his working life meant he had applied for positions at the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and the Disclosure and Barring Service. \"I have now been successful in those applications and the appointments have been made,\" he said. \"Lady Smith and I have discussed the potential that at some future time, a perception of conflict of interest may arise between these appointments and my work as a panel member on the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. \"After careful consideration of both the time commitment required to fulfil these new roles and the potential, however small, for perceptions to arise of conflict of interest, I have tendered my resignation to the inquiry.\" Mr Houston added that he had been \"honoured\" to be appointed to the panel. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he had accepted the resignation of Mr Houston and thanked him for his positive contribution. \"I know this was not an easy decision for him to reach, but he can be very proud of the contribution he has made to the establishment of the Child Abuse Inquiry and to ensuring its continuing progress,\" he said. In July 2016, senior judge Lady Smith was appointed as the new chairwoman of the inquiry following Ms O'Brien's resignation. A successor to Mr Houston will not be appointed to the inquiry so Lady Smith will continue as the sole panel member. The Scottish government said this brought it in line with other public inquiries established in Scotland under the 2005 Inquiries Act. The abuse inquiry has been plagued by problems since it was set up in October 2015. More than \u00c2\u00a33.5m has been spent on it during this period. Prof Lamb resigned in June 2016 claiming the inquiry was \"doomed\". Ms O'Brien stood down days later after being told she faced the sack over \"unacceptable\" comments about child sex abuse victims. The QC complained of government interference in the inquiry which she said had \"undermined\" her. But the Scottish government denied it was interfering with the inquiry and Lady Smith has also since insisted the investigation will be fully independent. Scottish Labour said Mr Swinney needed to reassure survivors the inquiry would not be delayed further and urged him to appoint more panel members. The party's education spokesman Iain Gray added: \"What is important is that the inquiry proceeds promptly so survivors can feel a sense of justice.\"",

Coleraine hammered Glentoran 4-1 at the Showgrounds with James McLaughlin scoring twice. David Jeffrey's Ballymena United ran out easy 4-1 winners away to Carrick Rangers to move into the top half of the table. Relive the action from Friday's Premiership matches . Despite suffering their first defeat of the season, Ards are still tied on points at the top of the table. There were few clear chances in the game, with defences on top before McAllister nodded past keeper Aaron Hogg and into his own net after 17 minutes of play. Crusaders and Linfield can overtake the joint leaders if they win their respective games on Saturday. The Bannsiders put four goals past Glentoran, who continued their disappointing start to the league campaign. Coleraine took the lead after eight minutes when referee Mervyn Smith pointed to the penalty spot when Elliott Morris was adjudged to have brought down James McLaughlin despite getting a strong palm on the ball. Neil McCafferty made no mistake from the spot by slotting past Morris, although the Glentoran keeper may feel aggrieved that he wasn't ready to face the kick. Three goals in nine minutes assured Coleraine of the points. Darren McCauley tucked home after being played through by Rodney Brown, before McLaughlin drove the ball home from the edge of the penalty area three minutes later. McLaughlin grabbed his second just after the hour mark to wrap up the victory, before Jonathan Smith fired home after some good work from Nacho Novo to give Glentoran a consolation goal. Defeat for Glentoran means that the East Belfast side slip into the bottom half of the table, while Coleraine's first victory of the season carries Oran Kearney's side up to eighth. Ballymena responded from last weekend's defeat by Ards in perfect style, putting four goals past Carrick Rangers. Allan Jenkins opened the scoring, slamming home from a corner after just three minutes. Cathair Friel doubled Ballymena's advantage on 22 minutes by heading in from a Tony Kane free-kick. Carrick Rangers were provided with a glimmer of hope when Alan Blayney picked up a back-pass and Gareth McKeown's free-kick rebounded off the United wall for Nathan Hanley to make no mistake from the rebound. Jonny McMurray scored Ballymena's goal of the evening, letting fire with a fine 30-yard strike which flew over Simon Steele in the Carrick goal.

The 2.4m euros (\u00c2\u00a31.8m) boat was built in England and is the smallest, fastest and lightest in the RNLI fleet. The boat was designed by Peter Eyre from Londonderry who was rescued by a Lough Swilly lifeboat when he was 14. Lough Swilly lifeboat operations manager John McCarter said it was an amazing new addition. \"It is probably the most advanced lifeboat that has entered the lifeboat fleet. It is absolutely new and fully up to date oat that has immense capabilities and we're the first station in Ireland to receive one. \"Indeed it's the first class of lifeboat to be named after an Irish river so it's a double first. It's an amazing bit of kit, we've had crews on it bringing it home and they are really over the moon on the capabilities the boat has and what an upgrade it will bring to the service here out of Lough Swilly. \"Peter cut his teeth sailing in Lough Swilly and got the bug for the water and has done a lot of good work within the RNLI and is pretty much the chief designer of this Shannon class boat and we're delighted that that is also a great connection to Lough Swilly, Derry and the north west.\" Peter Eyre who is now an RNLI naval architect based in Poole, in England was instrumental in the development of the new lifeboat. Mr Eyre attended Foyle and Londonderry College before studying ship science at the University of Southampton. He began designing the hull form at the age of 24 in his spare time. He said his own experience with the RNLI as a teenager was the inspiration for the boat. \"It was quite a stormy day on the Swilly and we were out sailing in our family yacht and lost the mast because of the strong winds and the Swilly crew came out to us and brought us to safety so that was my first foray with the RNLI. \"This boat is much quicker than the one it replaces, it does 25 knots. Time is of essence for most of these rescues and it's also much safer for the crews especially in rough weather. \"We would share a lot of the same base of suppliers with formula one so it's quite similar in the design approach using all the cutting edge technology available.

Under proposals, its A&E will close and the maternity unit be downgraded after neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust ran up debts of \u00c2\u00a3150m. The government said \"doing nothing is not an option\" and is to make a decision on 1 February. Campaigners are angry Lewisham Hospital, which is not part of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, is being targeted in a re-organisation of services across the area following the trusts's financial problems. Under the plans, the trust's Queen Elizabeth Hospital site in Woolwich would come together with Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to create a new organisation. Lewisham's A&E unit would then be downgraded to an urgent care centre, meaning emergency cases would be seen at nearby hospitals. The maternity unit at Lewisham could also be slimmed down, meaning complex cases would be dealt with elsewhere. South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs three hospitals, was placed in administration last year when it started losing about \u00c2\u00a31.3m a week. The problems it faces are not unique. Last year it was reported 20 trusts had declared themselves financially unsustainable in their current form. Matthew Kershaw, a special administrator, said in a report to the government that the trust should be broken up, with other organisations taking over the management and delivery of services. If implemented fully, Mr Kershaw said his recommendations would result in a radical overhaul of services in south London, and help deliver \"safe, high-quality, affordable and sustainable services.\" Mr Kershaw also recommended the Department of Health (DoH) write off any debts to ensure new organisations were not \"saddled with the issues of the past\". \"I have said consistently that the status quo is not an option, and I believe these final, refined recommendations are the right ones, although I appreciate that some people will find them difficult to accept,\" his report said. In November thousands of people marched in protest at the plans and BBC London reporter Matt Morris said at least 15,000 attended Saturday's event. The Save Lewisham Hospital group said 25,000 took part. Dr Louise Irvine, a local GP and chairman of the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign, said: \"This decision is crazy and ill thought out. \"It is a big mistake and carries huge clinical risks of things going wrong for patients but also political risk. \"If Jeremy Hunt can close a good local hospital here, he can do it anywhere in the country - nowhere is safe.\" A DoH spokesman said: \"Where trusts face long-standing problems we have been clear that doing nothing is not an option.\" The march went past Lewisham Hospital and ended with a festival in nearby Mountsfield Park.",

Some of the 69-year-old star's biggest hits include Brown Eyed Girl, Moondance and, fittingly, Here Comes the Night. His knighthood has been granted for \"services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland\". In a statement on Friday, Morrison said: \"Throughout my career I have always preferred to let my music speak for me, and it is a huge honour to now have that body of work recognised in this way. \"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have supported me on my musical journey.\" Morrison was born into a working-class family in east Belfast in 1945 but his exceptional talent has made him a global recording star. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"one of the greatest singers of all time\". The son of Harland and Wolff shipyard worker, he grew up in a small terraced house in Hyndford Street, in the shadow of the shipyard's famous cranes. His father's extensive record collection exposed the younger Morrison to a huge range of American musicians, including Hank Williams, Ray Charles, and Muddy Waters. Those early influences filtered into Morrison's own eclectic style which mixes soul, blues, jazz and country music with pop and rock. As well as selling millions of records worldwide, he has won six Grammys and a Brit award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. His relationship with stardom and the media has not always been comfortable. In 1993, he became the first living recipient not to attend his own induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, more recently he has accepted other accolades in person, including honorary degrees from both of Northern Ireland's universities. Last year, he was granted the freedom of his native city and celebrated the honour by playing a free concert at Belfast's Waterfront Hall. In total, 53 men and 32 women from Northern Ireland have been honoured by the Queen for their achievements in a range of fields and for their contribution to public life.

        "text": "The former Manchester United striker, best known for his winning goal against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final, arrived with great fanfare in January 2014. He presented a different vision for Cardiff compared with the defensive approach of his predecessor Malky Mackay, renowned for an unspectacular, yet effective style that gained the club promotion to the Premier League in 2013. Mackay's success meant popularity with fans and that probably didn't help Solskjaer's cause. The Scot's bitter falling-out with the club's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan had disillusioned many supporters who saw Mackay's sacking as a regression for a club who had fought so hard for a top-flight return after half a century away. He may have promised a more exciting style, but under Solskjaer the Bluebirds slipped into the Premier League's bottom three for the first time and never recovered, finishing bottom. The results were shocking - 3-0 at Swansea, 6-3 against Liverpool, 3-0 defeats against Crystal Palace and Newcastle and 4-0 losses to Hull and Sunderland. Tan blamed Mackay for relegation, which was confirmed at the penultimate game of the season, and expected a swift Premier League return under the Norwegian. And so began a big recruitment drive in the summer. Nine players came in, many of Mackay's men left, but it seemed even with so many new faces Solskjaer didn't know what his best team was. He named a different starting 11 for all of the games he oversaw this season and his tinkering was deemed to have had an adverse effect on results. Two home defeats in succession, against Norwich and Middlesbrough, sealed his fate. The nature of the capitulation against the Canaries caused particular concern, Cardiff leading 2-0 before conceding four second-half goals to lose 4-2. During the 1-0 loss against Boro four days later, the Cardiff crowd vented their frustration at the Norwegian, booing him as he tried to get the ball to one of his players to take a throw-in. After the game the Norwegian said he accepted the blame for the club's poor run of form. \"I'm responsible and I should get better results than we've had in the first seven games,\" said Solskjaer, who seems to have the ability to remain upbeat in the most trying of circumstances. The manager may be responsible for the team but many feel the board, and particularly owner Vincent Tan, have to take some responsibility too. \"It was the wrong appointment for Cardiff and the wrong club for Solskjaer,\" said former Cardiff captain Jason Perry on BBC Radio Wales. \"Do we know how Cardiff City play? No. \"I think only four players played against Blackburn [in the Championship opener] that played against Middlesbrough. He picked a different back four yet again. \"If you're manager or a coach you have a central strategy and you work on that.\" Solskjaer will not have the chance to find a strategy that works and attention now turns to the next man to work under Tan. Early favourites include Welshman Tony Pulis, who would be popular with fans given the job he did at Crystal Palace last season, and Dundee's Paul Hartley, who has overseen his club's rise to the Scottish Premiership. Things are rarely dull at Cardiff City. Whoever takes charge will discover that.",

A woman in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was taken to hospital with severe burns after she slipped on ice while attempting the trick, spilling boiling water on herself, the Argus Leader newspaper reported. The extreme weather resulted in the usual travel chaos - nearly 2,700 US flights were cancelled on Tuesday.

Referee Craig Joubert awarded the Wallabies a late penalty that replays suggested was an incorrect decision. \"You feel you're over it and then you see something and it brings it all back,\" Hogg told BBC Scotland. \"I was watching something on the TV a couple of weeks ago about the legacy of the World Cup and when us going out came up, it just brought back horrible memories. It was bitterly disappointing.\" Hogg is set to be included in a squad missing the injured Harlequins wing Tim Visser - ruled out of at least the first two games - and flanker Alasdair Strokosch, who retired from Test rugby after the World Cup. Another injury concern is Glasgow centre Mark Bennett, who was due to see a specialist on Monday to determine whether he needs an operation on his injured shoulder. The involvement of Warriors pair Ryan Wilson and Tim Swinson could hinge on the outcome of disciplinary proceedings against them following the European Champions Cup loss at Northampton. But club-mate and fellow midfielder Alex Dunbar could return to the Scotland fold after missing the World Cup with the after-effects of a knee injury sustained in training during last year's Six Nations. After the Calcutta Cup opener against England at Murrayfield on 6 February, Scotland travel to Cardiff - one of three away fixtures in this year's campaign - to face Wales in their second match a week later. Hogg says the squad will be desperate to banish the memories of not only their World Cup despair, but the embarrassment of a Six Nations whitewash last year. \"It is another challenge for us now, but we can take immense confidence from the World Cup,\" said the 23-year-old, who has only tasted victory in three of his 19 Six Nations matches since his 2012 debut. \"If I'm fortunate enough to be picked, hopefully we can produce something special in this Six Nations. England first up at Murrayfield is exactly what you want and it would be great to be part of that. \"Getting a good couple of wins early doors would give us immense confidence going forward, and we'd be in the tournament if that happens. \"We have let ourselves down in the last couple of Six Nations but we are looking forward to it.\" Hogg and his Glasgow team-mates will be hoping that joining up with Scotland provides a catalyst for rediscovering their World Cup form. Four successive defeats since Christmas have seen them slip to eighth in the Pro 12 table and effectively exit the European Champions Cup, after a third pool defeat on Sunday to Northampton. \"Our target was to become the number one team in Europe and we've fallen short again,\" Hogg noted. \"It's fine and well having good performances here and there but it's wins that we need. Europe is the be-all and end-all of club rugby so we're bitterly disappointed to no longer be part of it.\" After their final Champions Cup game against pool leaders Racing 92 at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park on Saturday, Glasgow - eight points off the Pro 12 play-off positions, but with two games in hand - must turn their attention to restoring last season's lustre. \"We're defending champions although to be honest we have not been playing like it lately,\" Hogg added. \"For us it's a challenge to get back up to where we belong.\"",

        "text": "It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry. He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'. But one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India. At the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes. And the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention. The reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent. This week Greenpeace won a small victory. On Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad. In January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India. But the war is far from over. The charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO. A secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity. It said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate. Greenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy. Coal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production. It is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change. And, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights. China's coal use of coal has been falling steeply, helping stall world growth in CO2 emissions. Meanwhile India's CO2 emissions are forecast to rise rapidly. According to the International Energy Agency, India is set to double its coal consumption by 2035 and become the world's largest coal importer by around 2020. Almost half of the 1,200 new coal-fired power stations proposed around the world are in India according to the World Resources Institute. That's why campaigning against the coal industry in India has been a priority for Greenpeace. The charity's campaigns have stopped coal mining in some of India's forest areas. The NGO will also have earned the government's ire by its relentless attack on two of India's corporate behemoths, Coal India and the Adani Group. Coal India is the biggest coal company in the world and India's fifth largest company. The Adani Group is the third biggest coal company in world and its head, Gautam Adani, is known to be close to the Indian prime minister. But the Indian government's attempt to muzzle Greenpeace and other NGOs has generated a chorus of criticism. India likes to celebrate its status as the world's largest democracy but the American ambassador to India has said its harassment of NGOs had a \"chilling effect\" on the nation's democracy. When the Indian electorate voted Mr Modi into power with a handsome majority a year ago they were voting for his promise to transform the Indian economy. Mr Modi is clearly determined to deliver on that promise. Indeed some Indians now fear that he may compromise some of the country's other core values along the way.",

And it calls for an urgent overhaul of the organisation. WHO says it has plans for reform. It has already admitted that it waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern. WHO Director General, Margaret Chan, admitted in May it had been \"overwhelmed\" by the Ebola outbreak, saying it \"shook this organization to its core\". The disease began spreading in December 2013, but it took until August 2014 for WHO to sound the alarm. By that point, more than 1,000 people had died of the virus. The death toll now stands at more than 11,000. According to the report, WHO lacked a culture of rapid decision-making. In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent about the seriousness of the situation but these \"either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance\". \"There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action,\" the report says. WHO was also criticised for failing to keep governments and the public up to speed about the extent and severity of the outbreak. But the review praised WHO for playing a critical role in pushing forward work to find new treatments and cures for Ebola. And it said WHO should be given the job of leading future health emergency responses - be that for Ebola or an outbreak of pandemic flu, for example. The report suggests an immediate contribution from all member countries towards a $100 million special outbreak response fund, and says WHO should establish a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The panel's head, Dame Barbara Stocking, former chief executive of the charity Oxfam, said the WHO must now be made fit for the task. \"To me, coming from somewhere like Oxfam which is an emergency culture, you are very much, if you like, on the front foot. You are always trying to prevent a situation coming through or grab it when it starts and really get it under control very fast and those are some of the internal changes that have to be made at WHO.\" The WHO said it was \"already moving forward\" on some of the panel's recommendations including the development of the global health emergency workforce and the contingency fund. It will be up to member states to make these voluntary financial contributions. Dr Joanne Liu, President of MSF International, questioned how the recommendations would translate to real action on the ground. \"We have seen so many reports calling for change, with everyone focused on how to improve future response and meanwhile, with 20-25 new Ebola cases per week in the region, we still don`t have the current epidemic under control. On Ebola, we went from global indifference, to global fear, to global response and now to global fatigue. We must finish the job,\" she said. Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said the support of the global community was crucial if we are to avert another catastrophe on the scale of Ebola.\"",

He took over in 1946, opening a shop on Goose Gate that sold the company's prams, which were manufactured on Alfreton Road, as well as treats for children, such as toys and comics. Auctioneer Nigel Kirk, of Mellors and Kirk, said the Victorians were \"very keen on prams\". \"Mr Whitby's father, a builder, and his grandfather were clearly men of considerable importance in Victorian and Edwardian Nottingham, of which they were both appointed freemen,\" he said. \"When he retired [in 2001], John Whitby had the foresight to carefully preserve everything connected with his grandfather's enterprise. \"For half a century the company was something of a Nottingham institution, selling not just prams but everything for the young child.\" The Victorian pram, which beat its estimate and sold for \u00a3590, has a \"coach-built body\" similar to the style used by the Royal Family to transport Princess Charlotte to her christening. A painted wooden sign, which once hung outside the shop, was also auctioned, as well as catalogues, photographs, toys, comics, shop display material and World War Two posters and souvenirs. Mr Kirk said: \"Some of the items would not have been considered valuable in many people's eyes - for example the trade catalogues from the 1960s, 70s and even 1980s, might have been overlooked in a house clearance. \"However, these lots sold incredibly well, particularly to online bidders.\"",

He was taken into police custody in London but later released without charge. He had bruises and hypothermia from outside temperatures as low as -41C, Austrian media reported. He survived because the plane flew at a low altitude to avoid stormy weather. The man apparently got under a fence at Schwechat airport in Vienna and climbed into the undercarriage of the first plane he saw without knowing its destination. The plane belonged to a sheikh from the United Arab Emirates and had been standing empty on the tarmac at Schwechat airport since Thursday. It flew without passengers to Heathrow, where the Romanian was picked up by police and arrested for stowing away. He could have been charged or fined or given a fixed penalty, the Metropolitan Police told the BBC. But he was cautioned and freed with no further action being taken, PA news agency reported. The man could also have been handed to the UK Border Agency. But it is understood that there is no immigration issue and that the agency will not seek to deport him, according to PA. As Romania is part of the EU, the man is free to enter the UK. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the stowaway was \"very lucky\" to be alive. \"If they don't find the right part to stow away, they can be crushed when the undercarriage comes up,\" he said. He added: \"Because of the altitude and temperatures during the flight, there is a severe risk to them through exposure and lack of oxygen. \"If that doesn't kill them, then they could be unconscious when the aircraft descends, and that can mean that when the undercarriage opens again, they will fall out.\" According to Austrian media reports, the man just wanted to get out of Vienna and look for work.

As a result she missed her connecting flight to meet the cruise ship. Ms Russell has since received C$800 (US$592; \u00c2\u00a3463) compensation from the airline. She says everything went according to plan until an agent told her about two hours after she had checked in and received her boarding pass that the flight was overbooked and she did not have a valid ticket. Despite showing her travel documents and getting the tour company to email her trip receipt to prove her ticket was valid, the flight left without her. \"It was extremely upsetting,\" Ms Russell told the CBC. \"The woman could not have been more rude, hostile. In all my years of travelling, I have never had a travel person treat me so badly.\" She was sent to Air Canada customer service at the airport to find a new flight to Miami. By the time she was seen by an agent, no flights were available that would allow her to make the connection. She also had to wait to get back her checked luggage. She filed a complaint for missing her \"dream vacation\" with Air Canada the next day. The $10,000 National Geographic cruise, organised by Lindblad Expeditions, tours the famous Pacific Ocean archipelago's varied islands and habitats. A spokeswoman for Lindblad Expeditions said on Friday they have been in contact with Ms Russell throughout the situation and have rebooked her expedition at no charge, including airfare from Miami to Galapagos. Air Canada confirmed that the flight had been oversold. But the carrier said their agents spent \"a great deal of time\" looking at options for Ms Russell, including exploring \"outside the box\" solutions for getting her directly to the Galapagos Islands despite her flight ticket being issued only to Miami. They noted they refunded her initial fare and paid compensation. \"This is a very regrettable situation and we are sorry this occurred,\" said an Air Canada spokesman in a statement. The practice of airlines bumping passengers from flights has been under scrutiny since the footage of United Airlines passenger David Dao being forcibly removed from a flight made headlines worldwide. Following that incident, Canada's federal government reiterated its pledge to table a passenger rights law this spring. It is expected to include compensation rules for those denied boarding due to factors within the carrier's control. The Canadian Transportation Agency receives an average of about 50 complaints a year from passengers saying they were denied boarding.",

On that occasion, there was a difficulty in getting telemetry through to Moscow mission control. In a statement on Tuesday, Urthecast confirmed that both cameras were passing data to the ground following the latest effort. \"During the installation, we were able to complete all of the intended tests during the spacewalk,\" the statement read. \"At this time, all telemetry received and analysed is within our expected results.\" The cameras were made for Urthecast by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire, UK. The high-resolution video unit should provide a resolution on the ground of about 1m per pixel. Large crowds and moving vehicles would be visible on this scale. The second camera will provide static imagery at a medium resolution of 5m per pixel. \"Testing of every part of the camera system will now follow. Once that's completed, we can expect the first imagery to be released publicly,\" said Prof Richard Holdaway, the director of RAL Space. \"We'll be helping Urthecast. We'll be checking the optical alignment and focus, to see that it is everything we expected,\" he told BBC News. Urthecast hopes to build a business around space station imagery. One of the customer sectors for the hi-res video, for example, is likely to be news organisations that want moving pictures of major events, such as war zones and regions of the Earth hit by natural disasters. It is hoping also to generate social media buzz around its imagery products, by enabling people to tag and share pictures through a special web portal. Urthecast is one of a group of Earth observation start-ups currently in the process of launching and commissioning space hardware. Skybox Imaging of San Francisco has already started to showcase video of Earth acquired by its small, free-flying SkySat-1 satellite. And Planet Labs, another San Francisco venture, has a \"flock\" of 28 nano-satellite imagers that are about to be released out of the airlock on the ISS. The station itself is increasingly becoming a platform for Earth observation. This is quite a challenge, however. The movement of the astronauts inside the ISS makes it flex, and there is a constant vibration from onboard equipment. All this requires cameras to have dampers built into their rigs to maintain a steady shot. The US space agency (Nasa) will be launching another two Earth-observing instruments to the station this year. One will study ocean winds and storms; the other will examine small particles in the atmosphere that can influence the climate.",

He said he would raise \"unnecessary\" tax burdens with the chief secretary to the treasury during the meeting. The Treasury said Scottish ministers had been advised of the tax situation before setting up national services. Most other police and fire services in the UK are regional bodies and do not have to pay VAT. The issue arose because Scotland's policing and fire services were previously controlled by local councils, which can claim back the tax - but the new national forces set up in 2013 are controlled by the Scottish government, which cannot. Mr Mackay said the police and fire services were struggling with the \"unnecessary\" burden of tax which they \"simple should not have to pay\". He said: \"This is a significant sum which other emergency services do not have to meet. \"There is a significant difference in the way VAT affects emergency services across the UK, with Scottish police and fire services paying VAT when other territorial services in the UK do not have to. \"There needs to be a level playing field for such essential services. \"As we continue to invest in our emergency services we will continue to press the UK government for Scottish emergency services to have the same ability to recover VAT as all other British and Northern Irish Forces.\" Scottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur said it was right that the VAT position was \"reconsidered\", but said the Scottish government should not use that as a \"smokescreen\" for its own failures. He said: \"The financial mess that Police Scotland find itself in is down to the SNP's botched centralisation. Ministers cannot duck that.\" A Treasury spokeswoman said: \"In 2012 the Scottish government chose to make Scotland's police and fire services national rather than regional bodies. The Scottish government were advised in advance that by making this change Scottish police and fire services would become ineligible for VAT refunds.\" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon raised the issue during a clash over police budgets with Tory leader Ruth Davidson at Holyrood in December. Ms Sturgeon argued that the UK government had changed the rules to exempt academy schools from VAT when they were set up and funded by the central government. She said there was \"\u00a325m a year which should be going to our police service but is going to the Treasury\". Ms Davidson replied: \"The Scottish government was warned about VAT - it knew what would happen and it did not listen to parliament. You know that the first minister is in trouble when she cannot answer for herself but runs to 'Westminster bad'.\" There have been a series of warnings from auditors about financial management within Scotland's police service, which faces a funding gap of up to \u00a3200m in the coming years.",

It would see the existing ban on TV ads extended to all media, including online outlets, the industry regulator said. Current limits on using celebrities and characters to sell food to children could be relaxed for healthier foods. About one in five children in the England is classed as obese by the end of primary school, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The self-regulatory body, CAP, which sets rules for UK advertising, said the new rules could make a \"meaningful contribution to tackling this important health issue\". Currently, food and drink deemed unhealthy can be advertised to children in non-broadcast media, unlike television where strict regulation prohibits it through content and scheduling restrictions. Ofcom research suggests that 96% of 12 to 15-year-olds spent more time online than watching TV last year. The advertising industry needed to make sure its regulations reflected changing media habits among young people, CAP said. Evidence showed advertising had a \"modest\" effect on children's food preferences, it said. However, factors such as parental influence, opportunities for physical exercise and education playing a greater role in solutions to childhood obesity, it argued. Chairman James Best said: \"Advertising is just one small factor in a very complex equation but we believe we can play a positive part in addressing an urgent societal challenge. \"In proposing new rules, our aim is to strike the right balance between protecting children and enabling businesses to continue advertising their products responsibly.\" Alex Neill, of consumer watchdog Which?, said a rule change was \"long overdue\", and vital to tackling childhood obesity. But Children's Food Campaign co-ordinator Malcolm Clark said the proposals had \"too many gaps in the detail of the consultation and scope for the rules to be weakened\". The regulator had \"missed obvious opportunities to make the UK a world leader in putting the protection of children's health above food and advertising industry profits,\" he said. The consultation closes on 22 July.",

Miss Pond was barred from the Smiler rollercoaster, the ride on which several people were seriously injured last year. In a Facebook post, Miss Pond, 33, from Shrewsbury, said she had been \"astonished\" to see a girl with her arm in a plaster cast allowed on to the ride. She wrote: \"I read the rules of the ride. You need to be able to walk 25m without help. And climb a ladder. Well I can assure you I can, nothing is wrong with my legs!\" She added: \"I'm still angry and upset. Never in my 33 years of life have I been treated with such discrimination over being born without my hand. \"I am not registered disabled as I'm too able bodied and for that reason can't claim any benefits.\" A spokeswoman for the theme park said: \"On arrival at the ride entrance, our staff did advise that for safety reasons, she would not be eligible to ride the Smiler. \"We aim to ensure that disabled guests are treated with respect and in a manner that is appropriate to their needs, whilst maintaining equality for all of our visitors.\" Miss Pond said the experience had put her off ever going to Alton Towers again and disputed the claim she was told at the ride's entrance she could not go on the rollercoaster. Alton Towers' owners, Merlin Attractions, face a large fine as a result of the Smiler crash last June. Last month Merlin admitted a health and safety breach over the crash, which resulted in two women having leg amputations.",

On Friday the National Electoral Council (CNE) declared more than 600,000 signatures on a petition for the referendum invalid. The opposition says the electoral authorities are biased against them. Venezuela is on the brink of economic collapse, facing high inflation and the shortage of food and basic goods. The opposition blames the Socialist policies of Mr Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, for the country's economic decline. The government says the country's economic elite, backed up by conservative forces in the United States and other countries, has been plotting to topple the government. One of Mr Maduro's closest allies, Jorge Rodriguez, has been appointed to check whether there are any irregularities in the recall referendum process. \"We have found a huge fraud against the Constitution,\" he said, after beginning legal action at the Supreme Court. \"Stop lying to the international community and stop lying to the Venezuelan people,\" he said. He stressed once again that it would not be possible to hold the referendum this year as the opposition wishes. On Saturday, Mr Maduro said the recall referendum would be held in 2017 if the opposition met the legal requirements. \"If they don't meet the requirements, there will be no recall referendum, full stop,\" said Mr Maduro. Timing is essential for both sides. If the referendum is held by 10 January 2017 and President Maduro loses, a new election will be called. If it is held after that date and the vote goes against him, his vice-president takes over and remains in power until the end of the presidential term, in January 2019. The opposition handed over the petition on 2 May. It said it had gathered the signatures of 1.85 million voters backing a recall referendum, many more than the 197,000 needed at this initial stage. The CNE said on Friday there were 1.97 million signatures on the list. The voters whose signatures have not been struck off by the CNE - more than 1.3 million people - will need to turn up at regional electoral offices to confirm their identities later this month. They will have five days from 20 June to have their signatures checked, CNE President Tibisay Lucena announced on Friday. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles urged voters to get ready to go to government offices to have their identities checked so the process can reach its next stage.",

The US foots more than a quarter of the UN's $7.9bn (\u00c2\u00a36.1bn) peacekeeping bill. A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the organisation was willing to discuss how peacekeeping could be made more cost-effective. Mr Trump's budget proposal declares new \"attention on the appropriate US share of international spending at the United Nations\". The document does not provide a detailed breakdown, but Reuters news agency reports the drop in funding for the operations could amount to $1bn. The spokesman said the UN was studying Mr Trump's plan. \"The figures presented would simply make it impossible for the UN to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance,\" he said. The BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN says such a warning from the organisation is unusually blunt. The US president does not set the budget, but makes recommendations to Congress. It is understood that the UN secretary general has been lobbying Congress members on the importance of international peacekeeping. The US provides 28.5% of the United Nations peacekeeping budget - almost three times as much as the next-highest contributor, China. While Mr Trump's plan does not include details, the US is known to want to cap its contributions to a maximum of 25%.

Alexa-Marie Quinn had 66 injuries including a bruise from her stomach to her ankles when she died last year. Wheatley was told he will have to serve a minimum of 21 years in jail before being considered for release. He had been awarded custody of Alexa-Marie in December 2013 - three months before he killed her. He admitted manslaughter, but the jury rejected his plea of not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The jury was told Wheatley beat Alexa-Marie with \"hard, sustained, persistent hitting\" after losing his temper. The blows were delivered with such force that fat deposits entered her bloodstream, blocking her lungs, and it was described as the culmination of a period of beatings lasting several weeks. Police found her body on 12 March 2014 and a pathologist said she died from \"extreme blunt-force trauma\". The jury was told that psychiatrists diagnosed Wheatley with multiple mental health disorders. Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan QC said Wheatley dialled 999 on the morning of the fatal attack, but by the time paramedics arrived it was likely Alexa-Marie had been dead for hours. Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent said: \"No child should suffer in this way and it is right that Carl Wheatley, who is a dangerous and violent man, was found guilty of murder and sentenced accordingly.\" Adrian Foster, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Without any eyewitnesses, we needed lengthy and highly technical evidence from top medical experts to help provide an explanation as to why this little girl died.\" Alexa-Marie had been removed from her mother's care some years earlier and had been living with foster parents in Bedfordshire before moving in with her father. Hertfordshire County Council said there would be an independent review of all the care agencies involved in looking after Alexa-Marie. Her mother issued a statement via Hertfordshire Police, in which she was not identified, which said: \"Myself and my extended family have been deeply traumatised by what Carl Wheatley has done. \"How anyone could cause such pain and suffering to someone so young and so sweet is truly beyond me. \"She will never have the chance to make daisy chains or go to a school prom and we will never be able to celebrate happy occasions, such as birthdays, Christmas and Mother's Day, because of what this man has done.\"",

Members found time to lodge 51 questions and motions - 28 of them from Willie Rennie on the China agreement. There was controversy about the issue during the election campaign. It emerged during the election period that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had signed the memorandum, potentially worth up to \u00c2\u00a310bn of investment, with SinoFortone and China Railway No 3 Engineering Group. At the time, Lib Dem leader Mr Rennie called for the agreement to be torn up after a parent firm of the engineering group had been blacklisted by Norway's state pension fund over fears of \"gross corruption\". Fears have also been voiced about human rights abuses. Ms Sturgeon said no firm investment plans had been made and insisted that due diligence would be carried out, although a UK advisor to the Chinese firms said specific projects had been discussed and claimed Ms Sturgeon wanted work to begin \"this year\". Mr Rennie lodged a total of 28 questions, all on the topic of the China agreement and government memoranda of understanding. He asked a series of questions about whether government officials were aware of the Norwegian blacklisting, their assessment of the firm's human rights record, what advice was taken before signing the memorandum, and whether the government would suspend the memorandum until it had investigated concerns. The Scottish Parliament website indicated that the questions were likely to be answered on 26 May. Ms Sturgeon has previously said that \"if there were any concerns that said these were deals we should not do, then we wouldn't do them\". A number of other MSPs also lodged questions on their first day back at work after the election. Labour MSP Neil Findlay submitted three motions, one of them on the \"growing number of Scottish citizens identified as being involved in undercover policing scandals\". His motion calls on the UK government to extend the Pitchford inquiry into undercover policing into Scotland, and says that if it does not, the Scottish government should set up an inquiry of its own. Mr Findlay also submitted a motion to welcome the verdict of the Hillsborough inquests, and another calling for directors of companies that take part in blacklisting to be tried in court. Green MSP Mark Ruskell, who has now returned to parliament having lost his seat in 2011, lodged 13 questions on his first day back in the job.

The shortest waiting time was in Terminal 4, where it took four minutes for passengers from the EU to clear the checks and two minutes for non-EU nationals. BAA said on Friday the longest wait passengers had was 77 minutes at Terminal 3, 75 minutes at Terminal 4, and 54 minutes at Terminals 5 and 1, with non-EU passengers facing the longest wait at the time. Matthew Donaldson, 38, from Lincolnshire, who arrived on a flight from Cape Town in South Africa at about 06:30, said he had to wait for an hour and 45 minutes to leave passport control at Terminal 5. He said: \"It was complete chaos. Half the escalators were closed to slow down the crowds and when we got to passport control there were snaking queues. \"They gave no reason and there were no senior staff there. \"It was erratic to say the least.\" George Galanopoulos, founder of London Executive Aviation which runs private jets, wrote on Twitter: \"Just landed at Heathrow T5... total chaos! Embarrassing for London.\" Simon Baugh, director of media relations at BAA, said the earlier situation at passport control, which is managed by the UK Border Force, the section of the UK Border Agency in charge of entry to the UK, was \"fairly typical\" but \"completely unacceptable\". He said: \"It's the UK's reputation and BAA's that suffers. There's no need for it. \"It's entirely about the level of resourcing the government needs to put in place.\" A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said: \"We will not compromise border security but we always aim to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to meet demand.\" She said there were extra workers at the border over the Easter period. Culture Select Committee chairman John Whittingdale outlined his committee's concerns about the airport's service in a letter to Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt which was made public this week. The letter, dated 21 March, said waits in excess of an hour might deter tourists from returning to the UK. The government sets BAA targets for processing departing passengers through security but no contractual service level agreements are in place for arriving passengers, said Mr Baugh. He said the Home Office sets an \"aspirational\" waiting time of no longer than 45 minutes for non-EU passengers and 25 minutes for EU passengers. Mr Baugh said: \"That bears no relation to customer experience.\"",

India also thrashed Bangladesh by 240 runs in a warm-up game last month. \"A lot of teams have surprised the opposition and we're not taking anything for granted,\" said Kohli. \"There are no guarantees in this sport. We're not going to go according to past results and what we've done in the past tournaments. \"We will use whatever momentum we've gained in this tournament to execute what we want to. \"Going into a big game like this, we're going to treat it as how we treated the last game. Our mindset does not differ.\" Bangladesh, who finished runners-up to England in Group A thanks to an impressive five-wicket win over New Zealand, are appearing in their first semi-final in a global competition. In 2015 they recorded their first ODI series win against India. \"Bangladesh have taken huge strides,\" said Kohli. \"They are a very dangerous side on their day and everyone realises that. \"They have cricketers who are skilled, who are committed to play for Bangladesh and play with a lot of passion.\" India opening batsman Rohit Sharma was limping during India's final practice, but Kohli hinted that they would name the same team that beat South Africa on Sunday, with spinner Ravichandran Ashwin keeping his place ahead of pace bowler Umesh Yadav. If selected, 35-year-old all-rounder Yuvraj Singh will make his 300th ODI appearance. \"His contribution to cricket has been outstanding,\" said Kohli. \"He's been a total match-winner for India, won so many big tournaments in big cities, and this is just a testimony to the kind of talent he possesses.\" Bangladesh were beaten by India in the 2015 World Cup quarter-finals, and were eliminated from last year's World Twenty20 when, with two runs required from three balls, they lost three wickets. \"Obviously we have been disappointed, especially in the T20 World Cup when we couldn't go through,\" said Bangladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza, who was captain for both matches. \"It happens sometimes in cricket, but we forget it. \"We can't just think what happened in the last two matches [because] coming into the ground it will put some more pressure on to us. \"We're playing the first time in our life in a semi-final, so that is a fact, but India have got more pressure than us because the huge population is there and people love cricket in India a lot.\"",

But the Tories said Labour's attacks were \"a massive own goal\". They said the Labour-led Welsh government had overseen increases in class sizes in Wales. Mr Corbyn, who insisted on Thursday that he could defy the polls and \"change the direction\" of the election, has used Labour analysis of Department for Education figures to focus on education. He said: \"The prime minister herself has said that super-sized classes are proof of a school system in a crisis. \"And that's what we've got on the Tories' watch. \"School leaders and teachers have said Tory cuts to school budgets will mean class sizes will be forced to grow even larger. We cannot risk our children's education in this way.\" In his speech, Mr Corbyn appeared to confuse some of the statistics released earlier by his party, inadvertently overstating the number of children in large classes. He told supporters: \"500,000 children in England - half a million children - are now being taught in super-sized classes of over 36\". The half a million figure is for class sizes of 31 - 34. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn had mixed the figures up. A Conservative spokeswoman dismissed Mr Corbyn's comments and pointed out that the number of infants in large classes had risen by 18% in three years in Wales. \"Of course we are not complacent about the situation in England,\" she added. \"There is more to do and that's why we are spending a record amount on schools - something we can afford to do because of our careful management of the nation's finances.\" Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Friday, Mr Farron will challenge Tory MPs who supported staying in the EU to oppose a so-called hard Brexit. He will add: \"If these Tory MPs reject these principles and back a hard Brexit manifesto, then people will know that on the biggest issue of the day they went missing in action.\" Chalk and cheese.

In the year covered by that report, 1,013 tests were conducted for IPC sports (which include athletics, swimming, powerlifting and skiing) in which prohibited substances were found nine times. During the year, sanctions were taken against 11 athletes. If you break that down into the sports involved it is clear that most of the IPC's anti-doping problems come from the sport of powerlifting, which was the source of seven of the positive tests and eight of the sanctions. The IPC announced in 2014 that it had suspended 13 powerlifters in the previous 14 months. The sport has been targeted with a \"Raise the Bar - Say No! to Doping\" campaign. Since then, the IPC has also adopted a new anti-doping code, which came into effect on 1 January 2015. Paralympic athletes have the same list of banned substances as Olympic athletes and, like them, anyone who requires additional medication for pain or treatment must apply for an exemption. \"It's a common misconception that a lot of Paralympians will be on prescription drugs. That's not the case at all,\" Nicole Sapstead, UK Anti-Doping chief executive, told the BBC ahead of London 2012. \"Obviously there are athletes with spinal injuries and they need pain relief. But mostly it is the same as the Olympics - things like asthma and diabetes.\" Only one athlete was given a doping sanction at the Sochi Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, but since then the McLaren Report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia's sports ministry manipulated urine samples provided by its athletes between 2011 and 2015. The report identified 27 samples relating to eight Para-sports, five of which are summer sports, including some governed by the IPC. The IPC also found evidence that samples were swapped during the Sochi Winter Paralympics, adding that it planned to reanalyse every Russian sample given at the event. So now the Russian team has been banned from this year's Paralympic Games in Rio, and the IPC is wondering if it has more of a doping problem than it previously thought.",

        "text": "A species of midge was able to release large volumes of nutrients into the soil, changing the way native species had lived and evolved, a UK team found. They added the species was well-suited to thrive in the extreme conditions. Details of the research were presented at the British Ecological Society's annual meeting in Birmingham. A team from the British Antarctic Survey said the invasive species, the non-biting midge Eretmoptera murphyi, effectively removed one of the brakes on the way that the native community had developed. \"In terms of function, their job is litter turnover - they help things decay in the soil - and the population density of this thing in the area where it has been introduced is responsible for more litter turnover than the community that was already there,\" explained co-presenter of the research Peter Convey, of the British Antarctic Survey. \"So basically it is bringing a function into an ecosystem that is not very active already. In principle, it can be a fundamental change in the way that ecosystem works.\" Speaking to BBC News before the presentation, Prof Convey warned: \"If you widen [this issue] beyond this particular species then probably the biggest risk is that we could drive locally or generally extinct some of the unique species that already exist in part of the Antarctic.\" He said that in a different project, the team had been looking at the tiny flies' evolution. \"Its native home is sub-Antarctica in South Georgia, and it has been on [the island] for several tens of millions of years. \"South Georgia is its own tectonic plate that has been moving away from South America for 30 or 40 million years. \"The Antarctic peninsula is another tectonic plate of a similar sort, and there are things on there that have got a similar multi-million, if not multi-tens of million-year histories.\" But Prof Convey explained that just because the two areas were located in a similar region, it did not mean the transfer of species between them did not have lasting consequences. \"You are looking at almost distinct bio-geographic regions, which have got their own distinct biodiversity. \"So if you transfer things between them - you have things like this fly that is pre-adapted - you also bring potentially new functions into the ecosystem.\" The threat of introducing a growing number of invasive species into the Antarctic's long-isolated ecosystems is increasing; the team highlighted that about 5,000 scientific staff and 30,000 tourists were visiting the continent each year. Prof Convey said: \"When people visit the Antarctic - whether that be tourists or people like me - we stop in the sub-Antarctic first, then we go on. So the biggest perceived risk at the moment is that people get a lot of mud on their boots, and then two days later you are in the South Orkney Islands, mud drops off boots - so the things are able to colonise the area. \"And then another day later, the ship reaches Elephant Island, which is at the tip of Antarctic peninsula, and then another day later it has got half-way down the peninsula. So you have got this potential step-carrying of things down the peninsula.\" Because species like the midge had the physiological characteristics to survive \"all the way down the peninsula\", it had the potential to have a wide and lasting impact, he observed. \"If we are not careful about the way we move around then we could be a very good carrying vector.\"",

Chairman Colin Smyth said: \"What we are now able to do is focus on what I think is the biggest issue as far as the public is concerned.

Campaigners against the \u00c2\u00a315m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots.

Shares in the US rose, with both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index up by 0.6% in morning trading. The past few days have seen huge swings on the world's financial markets as traders and investors struggled to assess the impact of the UK's vote to leave the European Union. After two days of heavy falls following the vote, shares spent two days recovering, and on Wednesday, the FTSE 100 ended above the level it had closed at last Thursday. However, the FTSE 250 index - which contains more UK-focused companies - still remains well below its pre-referendum level. \"The blue chip [FTSE 100] index is stuffed full with big international firms and it is these companies propelling the rise. The heavy weighting towards these groups is very misleading,\" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. \"The likes of Fresnillo, Randgold, AstraZeneca, Royal Dutch Shell, British American Tobacco - these are hardly dependent on, or reflective of, the UK economy.

The pound is well below the $1.50 rate it touched last Thursday before the outcome of the referendum became clear. As well as falling against the dollar after Mr Carney's speech, it also tumbled 1.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1962. Analysts continued to warn that the recent market recovery might only be temporary. \"The odds may be against them, but investors are hoping that the worst is over for currencies and equities,\" Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said in a note. \"But considering there's been no additional clarity on the terms of Brexit or the outlook for the UK economy and global economy since Britain's decision to leave the European Union on Friday, we don't see fundamental support for the recent moves.\" Analysts at Swiss bank UBS have cut their end of year forecast for the FTSE 100 to 5,500 from 6,500. \"We see a significant amount of uncertainty around the UK over the next few months.

John, then a doctor at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, took covert videos of women, without their knowledge, at The Harvey Centre in April 2011. It is understood he used a bag containing a concealed camera. One victim told police: \"The incident has made me feel dirty and degraded. I feel like I can't wear a skirt anymore and I am going to be scared every time I see a man with a bag. \"I feel violated as if he has actually touched me inappropriately.

Working-age household incomes have been stagnant since 2007-08 compared with a 10% rise for pensioners. Yet, 14% of pensioners households are still on low incomes. The DWP figures also show that in 2015-16, rises in pensioner incomes stalled. A number of reports and previous data have shown that income growth has been faster among pensioners than working-age people since the financial crisis. This has led to widespread debate over the future of the triple-lock - a promise made to pensioners that the state pension will rise in line with prices, wages or 2.5%, whichever is highest. This latest set of figures shows that recently retired pensioners in the UK have seen their incomes rise compared with a decade ago. Average incomes among this group have risen from \u00a3314 in 2005-06 to \u00a3357 in the last financial year. The DWP figures show a regional split, with older people in the South East of England having much higher incomes than those living in Wales and the West Midlands. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy at Royal London, said: \"While there are clearly some pensioners who enjoy good company pensions and have benefited from house price inflation, there are clearly also many who are not in such a fortunate position. \"Any change to policy on state pensions need to take full account of the diversity of experience of pensioners in Britain today, and not simply assume that pensioner living standards will keep on rising.\" For all UK households, the median average income rose by \u00a38 in a year to \u00a3481 a week before housing costs in 2015-16. This stood at \u00a3413 a week after taking housing costs into account, the DWP figures show. Agnes Norris Keiller, a research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said: \"Growth in household incomes in 2015-16 was modest but widespread, continuing the pattern seen in recent years. \"The period since the recession has been defined not by sharp rises in inequality or poverty, but historically slow growth in average incomes - in 2015-16 average income for working-age adults was no higher than eight years previously.\" Official figures published on Wednesday showed that wage growth had slowed to 2.3% (excluding bonuses) in the three months to the end of January, from 2.6% in the previous three-month period.",

Organisers said the growth of fake news and misinformation made it crucial to highlight science's \"vital role\". It took place on Earth Day, which promotes environmental protection. Supporters gathered outside the Science Museum in Kensington, bearing placards on which double helices and chemical symbols sat alongside political slogans. Thousands then marched to Parliament Square passing institutions such as the Royal Society. Many of them were protesting against what they see as a trend among politicians for discrediting scientific research. Concerns that rhetoric threatens to override research flared in the UK last summer when former cabinet minister Michael Gove claimed during the EU referendum campaign that the public had \"had enough of experts\". In the US, President Donald Trump has previously called climate change a \"hoax\", raising concern in the scientific community there that the public were beginning to doubt the facts provided as scientific evidence. Organisers said the events were also a celebration of science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi and comedian Robin Ince were among those who joined activists in London. Mr Ince, who hosts the scientific podcast The Infinite Monkey Cage, said: \"I think there are many reasons people are out here. \"I think we're worried about the fact there seems to be a reigniting of parochialism in politics... \"I think the idea of deriding experts, the idea of deriding people that spend their entire life researching and experimenting, is a return to charlatanism if we start doing that.\" The Commons Science and Technology Committee this month stressed the importance of allowing scientists and experts to come to the UK following Brexit. It followed a host of warnings from influential figures in the scientific community that divorce from the continent could have a crippling impact on research and provoke an exodus of talent. In March, Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse said: \"I don't think there's anything in Brexit that helps universities, either in teaching or research, but we are where we are... we have to make the best of it.\" Parallel marches were hosted across the UK, including in Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff and Edinburgh.

They were assessed on a range of measures, including teaching quality, student satisfaction, drop-out rates and whether students go on to employment or further study after graduating. A gold award means a university is of the highest quality found in the UK, providing \"consistently outstanding teaching, learning and outcomes for its students\", while the silver award was given for consistently exceeding \"rigorous national quality requirements for UK higher education\" and bronze was awarded to those that met these national requirements.

Both Jess Phillips, Labour, and Maria Miller, Conservative, said they were concerned by the case and would write to the attorney general. Bashir's ex-wife said she was \"disappointed\" by the judge's comments. At Manchester Crown Court, Bashir of Hebers Court, Middleton, Manchester, admitted two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Judge Richard Mansell said his decision on the sentence was guided by the fact he was \"not convinced [Bashir's then wife] was a vulnerable person\" as she was \"an intelligent woman with a network of friends\" and a degree. Despite acknowledging the attacks had an \"ongoing effect\" on his victim's ability to trust people, he sentenced Bashir, who played cricket for Oldham, to 18 months, suspended for two years. Speaking to the BBC, which has agreed not to use her name, Bashir's ex-wife said she was \"disappointed in the comments which the judge made about my vulnerability\". She added: \"I am a confident and strong woman because of what I have suffered. I was suffering for my life but the judge didn't believe me.\" The judge also ordered Bashir to attend a workshop entitled ''building better relationships'', pay \u00c2\u00a31,000 costs and banned him from contacting his ex-wife indefinitely. Ms Phillips, who is MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the judge's comments sent a \"dangerous\" message. \"Your vulnerability and your risk is a completely dynamic thing,\" she said. \"Everybody has a dynamic risk, I've met women who went on to be murdered who had law degrees, who were very eminent business people. \"There's no category that domestic violence does not touch. It does not follow class lines, it does not follow race lines, it does not follow age lines.\" Ms Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told the BBC: \"The brutality of the sort of acts that have been outlined really make me believe that this was a devastating episode in the victim's life. \"I do think this needs to be properly understood by judges and it needs to be properly accounted for in sentencing.\" An apparent defence claim, noted by the judge, that a prison sentence would have lost Bashir a contract with Leicestershire County Cricket Club (LCCC) has been rejected by the club, which denies it has ever been in contact with Bashir.

He told the BBC that only Conservatives offered a referendum on UK membership. The BBC's Nick Robinson said this \"simple message\" instilled confidence for many within the party. UKIP gained 23 MEPs, with the Tories having 19, behind Labour which has 20. The Conservative share of the vote was 23.9%, behind Labour on 25.4% and UKIP on 27.5%. Some Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the performance and Mr Cameron said he was \"disappointed\" for the MEPs - including its former leader in Brussels Martin Callanan - who lost their seats. But he said the vote reinforced his belief that the UK's relationship with the EU needed to change. \"I take a very clear message from the election. People are deeply disillusioned with the EU. They don't feel the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change. \"I would say that message is absolutely received and understood.\" While he was an instinctive \"reformer\" who, in the referendum would \"give the choice to the British people of whether to stay or go\", Labour backed the \"status quo\" in Europe and the Lib Dems did not want any change. Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that UKIP's victory was a snub for the Westminster elite in general and for Mr Farage's different campaigning style, saying the UKIP leader was a \"consummate politician\" who was already discussing tactics for the 2015 general election. He again dismissed any talk of pre-election pacts, at either a national or constituency level, saying he was \"100%\" focused on delivering an outright Conservative victory. He said Labour had got a lower share of the vote in the 2004 European election and managed to comfortably win a general election the year after. \"It is possible to win from here,\" he said. \"We have just got to have a real focus on what really matters which is completing our economic plan and turning our country round.\" Foreign Secretary William Hague said the rise of Eurosceptic parties should serve as a wake-up call to European politicians. UKIP's support would switch for next year's general election, he told BBC News. \"They can have a free hit; they can have a vote that does not have the consequences of bringing the wrong government in,\" he said. \"So it is very different to a general election.\" But backbencher Bernard Jenkin wrote on Twitter: \"Some of us who opposed Maastricht 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the EU: and here we are.\" And Clacton MP Douglas Carswell added: \"So maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about Europe were on to something?\" The European election results come just days after the Conservative Party lost more than 200 seats in local polls, prompting ministers to promise tougher curbs on immigration.

        "text": "The Information Commissioner is to be asked to overrule a decision by the National Archives to keep the documents about the trial of Stephen Ward hidden. The submission is being made by lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. It is believed Ward killed himself as his trial for living off immoral earnings was ending. Ward, an artist and osteopath living in London, had in 1961 introduced 21-year-old reputed call girl Christine Keeler to the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. The minister and Ms Keeler - who is also thought to have had relations with an attache at the Russian embassy, Yevgeny Ivanov - started an affair. When challenged, Profumo initially denied the relationship - but was later forced to admit that he had lied in March 1963, in a scandal that threatened to topple the Conservative government of the time. Ward, who many believe was a victim of a cover-up, is understood to have killed himself on the last day of his trial at the Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Ms Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, who were referred to at the time of the court case as prostitutes. Mr Robertson, the author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK, said that he was making the appeal because keeping documents about Ward's trial hidden \"was irrational and ignores the public interest and the interests of history in discovering the truth about Ward's conviction, which is widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice\". He added: \"Releasing the official trial transcript is important to work out why Ward was ever prosecuted, and it will assist the case for overturning his conviction.\" The National Archives refused Mr Robertson access to most of its file on Ward, which is believed to include the police statements used to charge him with living off the earnings of Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies. Mr Robertson argues in his book that neither woman was a prostitute, and both in fact lived off Ward's earnings as a celebrated osteopath and portrait artist. The file on Ward is currently closed from public view until 2046, because this is 100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses. The Information Commissioner is set to make a decision to see if it can be opened earlier. According to Mr Robertson, this \"will cast an important new light on one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern British history, and help explain how Stephen Ward was made the scapegoat for the Profumo affair by prosecuting him for crimes that neither he nor anyone else ever committed\". A spokesman for the National Archives said it did not want to provide a comment. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it had not yet received Mr Robertson's submission.",

The Gypsy Council said the authority had been quick to get an injunction but refused to provide enough gypsy sites. The council said it \"utterly refutes\" the accusation of racism. Housing applications in the area had been judged acceptable against the borough's planning policies, drawn up following a statutory process including consultation, it said. Caravans arrived on the Berkshire site on 24 April with the permission of the landowner, who is part of the gypsy community. But the council has taken legal action because developments that have since taken place do not have planning consent. It obtained the injunction to prevent further caravans and development on the Berkshire site, after its deadline to exit the site by Monday 27 April was ignored. \"This is not a site allocated for development in the council's local plan,\" said director of environment, Helen Thwaites. \"It is located within the countryside where the council's policies seek to protect the rural character.\" Residents near the site, in Blagrove Lane, have also expressed concern. Ian Andrews, of Evendons Area Residents' Association, said there was unhappiness at \"a total disregard for the planning process in a quiet rural location\". \"Hedgerows have been ripped out during nesting season and more than 50 giant lorry loads of rubble have been dumped into what was the flood plain for several hundred homes,\" he said. Residents had also expressed fear of a rise in crime, which Thames Valley Police said was \"unfounded\".

Their equations suggest a slow underarm throw is the best strategy for getting a piece of paper into a nearby bin. Lead researcher Madhusudhan Venkadesan, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Yale University, said faster throws tend to be less accurate. This is because the ball travels in a nearly straight line, so any errors in the angle at which the object is released tend to be amplified. In slow and curved flight paths, small errors in the angle of release have little effect, he said. \"What we find is that almost the slowest arc is often the most accurate,\" said Dr Venkadesan. \"We've compared these calculations to published data of people throwing into wastebaskets; we've compared it to a study in dart throwing.\" In sports such as basketball or darts, the strategy depends on conditions and the trade-off needed between speed and accuracy. For example, experienced darts players throw overarm at about 5.5 metres per second, optimally releasing the dart 17 to 37 degrees before the arm becomes vertical. On the cricket pitch, fielders are more likely to strike the wicket with a fast underarm throw. And in basketball, the underhand free throw, nicknamed \"the granny throw\", has a marginal advantage over overhand, despite almost disappearing from the game. Accurate throwing is uniquely human - a skill relied upon by our ancient ancestors for hunting with spears or stone tools. The researchers say monkeys also throw things, but they are really bad at it. The study is published in the journal, Royal Society Open Science. Follow Helen on Twitter.",

Middlesex, also aided by Toby Roland-Jones' 3-81, chose to not enforce the follow on, despite being 212 ahead. Sam Robson hit 77 and Nick Gubbins 64 as the hosts declared on 239-3, and Essex ended 19-0 chasing 452 to win. Given the forecast for rain on the final day, the decision not to put Essex back in to bat again was surprising. However, Robson and Gubbins built on their first-innings centuries to ensure the best chance for victory possible if the weather holds out. After dismissing former England captain Alastair Cook cheaply on day two, Roland-Jones took his third wicket of the match with the 14th ball of the third morning, as Ravi Bopara was caught at third slip, continuing his poor batting form this season. That brought Wheater to the crease, and alongside Lawrence the pair dragged Essex away from a disastrous reply to Middlesex's 507-7 declared, but Wheater was eventually out to a brilliant one-handed tumbling catch by Stevie Eskinazi at square leg to reduce the visitors to 253-6. Ryan ten Doeschate (20) was then trapped plumb lbw by Tim Murtagh, Simon Harmer hit a wide ball to Eskinazi's hands, and Lawrence and Neil Wagner were dismissed by Finn (4-51) as the final four wickets tumbled in nine overs. At a pace of more than six runs an over, Middlesex thundered to a lead of 451, thanks to Robson, Gubbins and fellow first-innings centurion Eskinazi, who hit 62 in 34 balls, going to his fifty with three successive sixes into the Grand Stand off Jamie Porter. Essex faced six overs late in the day and opener Nick Browne survived a scare when Ollie Rayner dropped him at second slip off Roland-Jones when he was on eight. Middlesex head coach Richard Scott told BBC Radio London: . \"We decided not to enforce the follow-on because our bowlers had sent down almost 100 overs in their first innings. \"We wanted to give them a session's rest so they could come back again strong and also have the chance of bowling fresh in the morning. \"Our batsmen actually did brilliantly to accelerate the scoring rate and get us a lead of 450 in time for us to have six overs at them before stumps.\" Essex wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Wheater told BBC Radio Essex: . \"We tried to slow the scoring rate in their second innings but their top three all played really well. \"With the small boundary on one side it is hard to defend it. \"We just have to bat well on the last day and you never know what can happen.\"",

AFS analysed the 25 which had been published by the end of April 2014 and said some progress has been made in how they are controlling the availability of alcohol. But its chief executive, Dr Evelyn Gillan, said the licensing process was too removed from the people and neighbourhoods most affected by the boards' decisions. She said: \"Licensing boards have an important role in trying to minimise the harm that alcohol can cause because they have the power to control how much alcohol is available in their areas. \"The good news is that some boards are working well with the police and health professionals, declaring more areas of overprovision and actively seeking the views of local communities in licensing decision-making.\" However, she added: \"There is a lack of transparency about how the evidence of alcohol harm presented to licensing boards by health, police, and local people has been listened to and acted upon.\" The number of alcohol licences in Scotland has remained broadly static in recent years, according to government figures. In 2012/13 there were 16,237 premises licences across Scotland - 11,363 on-sales and 4,874 off-sales.

They included in Glasgow, North Ayrshire, Aberdeen, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland and East Lothian. Fiona Moss, head of health improvement at Glasgow City Community Health Partnership said: \"We were invited to give evidence during the consultation process and I was pleased with the way the licensing board considered this evidence and listened to the principal health messages. \"I welcomed the board's decision not to further extend routine licensing hours and not to grant further breakfast licences within the new policy.\" The AFS report recommended boards should produce detailed statistics to enable effective monitoring of the licensing system.",

        "text": "The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, says the 16 million fares currently on offer are \"baffling\" for passengers. It wants to ensure passengers are offered the cheapest possible fares. The trial, starting from May, will initially benefit people travelling between Scotland and south-west England. A traveller buying an off-peak return from Wick, in northern Scotland, to Par, in Cornwall, can currently pay up to \u00a3342.50, although in practice few people pay that amount. However, by buying six separate fares for each leg of the journey, passengers can pay as little as \u00a380 for the same trip. That would involve buying tickets from Wick to Inverness, Inverness to Edinburgh and Edinburgh to Par. The RDG says the potential saving of \u00a3262 will soon be offered to customers automatically. CrossCountry Trains, the main operator taking part in the trials, may eventually offer savings on other routes as well. Passengers travelling between London and Glasgow, or London and Edinburgh on Virgin Trains, will also benefit from clearer pricing. Operators currently have to offer a return fare between these cities, which is regulated by the government. But the RDG says it would be more transparent - and possibly cheaper - for commuters if single fares were regulated instead. It wants more booking of single fares - at ticket offices and ticket machines, as well as on the internet. Ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"We're determined to overhaul the system to cut out red-tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines,\" said Jacqueline Starr, RDG director of customer experience. The trial will also see the removal of some historic fares which do not make sense. Ben Morris, business reporter . In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket. Today's scheme aims to make those savings available to everyone. At the moment passengers travelling between London St Pancras and Sheffield pay extra to travel via Grantham, for example, even though it takes longer. Such fares date back to the pre-privatisation era of British Rail. News of the trial was welcomed by passenger groups. \"What's clear from our research is that passengers find the ticketing system far too complex,\" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus. \"The presence of cheaper fares that are 'hidden' in the system really damages trust between passengers and train companies.\" However Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, said more needed to be done. \"It's quite simple. When you book a rail ticket, whether it's in a station or online, people should be given the cheapest price available at that time for their chosen journey. \"These changes will not make that happen. While it is certainly a move in the right direction, people cannot have the confidence that if they book a ticket, they will be paying the best price,\" he said. The price of average train fares - including regulated and unregulated tickets - went up by 2.3% in January, even though consumer prices rose by just 1.6% last year. The rise led to protests by passengers and rail unions.",

The figures mark a sharp decline from the 440 animals recorded 10 years ago. Experts say the decline is mainly down to rampant poaching. But they add that lower numbers also reflect more accurate surveying techniques. All previous surveys counted tiger paw prints - which are unique to each animal, but difficult to spot, collate and analyse. The hidden cameras yielded lower - but more accurate figures, they say. Experts say the gangs killing the tigers trade in tiger skin and body parts. \"The numbers have declined largely because of poaching, which is the main threat to the tigers in Sunderbans,\" Dr Anwarul Islam, Professor of Zoology at Dhaka University, told the BBC. \"The threat comes not only from stray poaching, which is rampant, but also from organised gangs of poachers. \"Unless we have an independent, dedicated anti-poaching unit, the future is not bright for the tigers in Bangladesh.\" There are now fewer than 2,300 Bengal tigers left in the wild - mainly in India and Bangladesh, but with smaller populations in Nepal, Bhutan, China and Myanmar (also called Burma).

Two people were killed and five police were injured in attacks on a free speech debate and a synagogue. The gunman was later shot dead by police. He did not appear to be part of a wider terror cell, Denmark's PM said. Earlier on Monday, two men were charged with providing and disposing of the weapon used in the attacks and helping the gunman to hide. The gunman was named by local media as Omar El-Hussein. The national flag flew at half-mast on official buildings across the capital on Monday. Floral tributes have been placed by mourners at the site of the two attacks. Some also put flowers at the place where police shot the suspect dead. One told Danish TV2: \"I did it because I am Muslim and because I knew him.\" As dusk fell on Monday a vast crowd gathered for the Copenhagen event, held on a square near the cultural centre where one of the attacks took place. A police spokesman said the crowds numbered about 30,000. Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt told the audience that an attack on the Jews of Denmark \"is an attack on Denmark, on all of us\". She also again vowed that Denmark was determined to safeguard its values. The prime minister earlier told a news conference the attacker was a Danish-born man aged 22. \"He was known by the police for several criminal acts, including severe violence, and he was also known to be linked to a criminal gang in Copenhagen. \" \"But I want to also make very clear that we have no indication at this stage that he was part of a cell.\" Omar El-Hussein: homegrown radical . The two suspects being held by police appeared in a closed custody hearing on Monday. Michael Juul Eriksen, a defence lawyer for one of them, said they denied the charges. Omar El-Hussein was released from prison two weeks before the attacks after serving a sentence for grievous bodily harm. Danish intelligence chief Jens Madsen acknowledged that El-Hussein had been \"on the radar\" of his services. Mr Madsen said investigators were working on the theory that he could have been inspired by the shootings in Paris last month. The attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, a kosher supermarket and a policewoman claimed 17 lives. In the first of the two shootings on Saturday, at a free-speech debate in the east of the city, film director Finn Norgaard, 55, was killed. In an audio recording of the shooting, the gunman can be heard interrupting the debate and firing dozens of shots. Hours later, Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old long-time member of the Copenhagen synagogue, was shot dead while on security duty outside the building. Eighty people were celebrating a girl's bat mitzvah, or coming of age, in a hall behind the synagogue at the time. The gunman fled by car but was traced by police to the city's Norrebro district. He opened fire when confronted and was fatally shot by officers. In another development, controversial cartoonist Lars Vilks - who believes he was probably a target of one of the attacks - says he has gone into hiding. He told Channel 4 News he was now in a \"secret place\". Finn Noergaard, 55, was struck in the chest by a bullet at the free speech debate. The documentary film-maker had a keen interest in the problems faced by the offspring of migrant communities. His friend Malene Trock told Berlinske daily he was \"open-minded\" and \"cosmopolitan\". Producer Torben Larsen is quoted by the AP news agency as saying Mr Noergaard was \"a very generous and warm person\". Dan Uzan, 37, was shot dead while standing guard at a Copenhagen synagogue. He had studied at the city's university and was a keen basketball player, active in a local team. Denmark's chief rabbi, Jair Melchior, said Mr Uzan was an \"amazing guy - irreplaceable\".

Fortunately, Mr Krebs was already monitoring the website and saw the plot being planned in real time. He alerted the FBI and local police. \"I am little concerned\", he told the BBC. \"But then there are a lot of things people can do to upset you and get under your skin using a keyboard and few clicks of a mouse. \"But what's the next level?\" The person behind the attempted plot, according to Mr Krebs, set up a bitcoin wallet to accept donations of the digital currency from fellow forum members. He raised about $200 (\u00c2\u00a3131) worth of bitcoins and used it to buy 12 small bags of heroin using the Silk Road online black market. The package duly arrived at Mr Krebs's house, and he handed it over to the police. This is just the latest example of a sustained smear campaign against Mr Krebs orchestrated by hackers and cybercriminals disgruntled at his exposure of their antics. In March he was visited by a heavily armed police unit tricked into responding to a 911 call that had been made to look as if it originated from his home. Mr Krebs says he opened the front door to find a squad of policemen pointing a battery of guns at him. After being hand-cuffed and questioned, he managed to persuade the police they had been hoaxed by hackers. The informant had used a instant message relay service designed for hearing impaired and deaf people to pretend to be Mr Krebs reporting that Russians had broken into his home and shot his wife. The phenomenon, known as swatting, after the special weapons and tactics (Swat) teams called out to handle hostage and other dangerous situations, had begun on the West Coast, the police told Mr Krebs, but had been working its way eastwards. \"This type of individual prank puts peoples' lives at risk, wastes huge amounts of taxpayer dollars, and draws otherwise scarce resources away from real emergencies\", Mr Krebs blogged. \"What's more, there are a lot of folks who will confront armed force with armed force, all with the intention of self-defence.\" Mr Krebs also says his website suffered a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. This is when a large number of hijacked computers flood another computer server with messages to render it helpless. The site was taken offline temporarily as a result.

        "text": "In 1787, the 28-year-old Robert Burns was suddenly a \"celebrity\", according to Prof Nigel Leask, regius chair of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow. The 2nd Edinburgh edition of his poems had given him a quite a handsome pot of money and it had also made him famous, with the cream of Scottish society taking an interest in him. Prof Leask says: \"He was the lion of Scottish literature, everyone wants to meet him.\" And Burns also wants to meet them, especially if they have the power to promote his work further and the cash to buy his books. \"Poets in the 18th Century depended on patronage so he tours around the gentry and nobles, really doing a bit of salesmanship,\" says Prof Leask. Throughout 1787 Burns embarked on a series of tours, firstly around the Scottish Borders and northern England and then further afield to the west Highlands taking in Inveraray, Arrochar and dinner with Glasgow tobacco merchant George Buchanan at Arden House at Bannachra near Loch Lomond. Later in the year he toured the Highlands during which time he stayed with the Duke and Duchess of Atholl at Blair Castle, dined with the Duke and Duchess of Gordon at Castle Gordon and visited historical sites such as the Culloden battlefield and Cawdor Castle, which featured in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Prof Leask says that Burns seems to have had letters of introduction from Edinburgh patrons that gained him access to the upper-echelons of Scottish nobility. \"He's not overawed by his posh surroundings,\" says Prof Leask. \"It shows his amazing social versatility. He's got an ability to move in all the circles of society. \"There is a sense of how thoroughly he was in the society and culture of the late 18th Century.\" Prof Leask says: \"It slightly qualifies the image of the 'heaven-taught ploughman' who does not have formal qualifications, who is just a genius endowed by nature. \"This shows how learned he was, how much he knew.\" Prof Leask says the tours of the Highlands are also important because it was a Lowlander's encounter with Gaelic culture, the Highland culture of Scotland. During his travels he composes songs like the Birks of Aberfeldy and discovers his east coast heritage, visiting relatives in Stonehaven and Laurencekirk. His father's family had a strong connection to the Jacobites in the north east. As well as mixing with the Scottish nobility there was plenty of time for the rock star antics for which Burns has become well known. Prof Leask recounts how Burns stopped for the night at Arden House near Loch Lomond. \"He has a very convivial night of dancing and drinking and seeing the sun rise over Ben Lomond,\" says Prof Leask. \"He sets off the next day and has a horse race on the road down to Dumbarton with a Highland man he calls Donald, who is riding an unharnessed horse and Burns is riding Jenny Geddes, his old mare. \"He is determined not to be overtaken so he races and has an accident. \"It's a bit like two boy-racers on the A82 nowadays.\" The tour journals are included in the new \"Oxford Edition of the Works of Robert Burns: Commonplace Books, Tour Journals and Miscellaneous Prose\". Prof Leask says: \"This is the first time the tours have been edited to scholarly standards and cross-referenced with his poems, songs and letters. \"It enables the reader to get a good sense of how these tours contributed to his emergence as a major world poet.\"",
